Randy Smoothieking is groggy.  The haze of knockout drugs swim in his head,  and his body is, once again, no longer his own.  Hunter's body again, it must be.  His deep sigh fills the silence, and is punctuated by the clack of heels on the tile floor.  He tries to move his head, but it is held fast.  Arms too, and legs. Fuck.

The heel clicking stops, and another sigh fills the room, but this time it is not his.  A throat clears.  "Hunter." the voice is husky and deep, the product of a pack a day, and not of the safe stuff, the old stuff, rolled in paper, filled with unimaginable toxins.  "Please explain to me why I'm here."

Randy spills everything in the first breath, following it up with a giant inhale. The teleporter accident, the drug deals, Chase's involvement in the King Pin's operation.  He spares no detail, no piece of information.  He must make sure Maxwell is safe.

The man, clearly the Agency Head, snorts as he digests the information. "This sounds," he breaths in, "highly unlikely."

"But, Sir, I'm telling you the truth, all of it, just look at the security logs.  You'll be able to see that I'm telling you the truth."

The man, in view for the first time, leans in close to Randy's face.  The smell of this morning's coffee hangs heavy as he speaks.  "How am I supposed to see a mind transfer?"

The sound of a chair scraping against the tile from somewhere behind Randy's head startles him.  Vanessa speaks up, "I can do a psychospectral analysis on the footage.  I should be able to determine if a mind transfer occurred or not."

"And what of his teleporter?  We do not have any research dedicated to teleporters."

"But it's true!" Randy draws out the last vowel sound into a whiny that causes the Agency Head to roll his eyes.

A voice from the hallway calls out, "Hunter Strong!  There you are!"  The voice is tinny and thin.  "What have you done with my teleporter?"

"Quaid?  Why are you wasting your time on teleporters?"

"Agency Head, I'm sorry, Sir, it was a small side project, and this scoundrel stole it from me.  Give it back, Hunter!"

"Sir," Vanessa points towards the viewscreen, "There are, indeed, two minds cohabiting the footage, and you can clearly see," she zooms into Hunter and Randy holding the teleporter, "the shift in psychospectral energy right there." She pauses the video.  From Randy's vantage point, he cannot see what is on the screen.

Quaid gasps, "That's, that's not supposed to happen."

"Well it did!"  The Agency Head slams his fist into the console.  "Fix it!" The sound of his boots punctuate his departure.

"If I can reverse the polarity, and reharmonize the frequencies, I should be able to send him back to his own body, and get Hunter here."

"Oh, that would be lovely, but first, we must arrest Hunter.  Hunter, you, as a criminal, have forfeited all rights under Unified Temporal Code 267.3 stroke 5.  Anything you think can and will be used against you to ensure your conviction.  And under the Treaty of Madrid, you are forfeit your right to appeal, and are immediately sentenced to carbonation."

"Wait, what?"  Randy struggles against his restraints.

"Oh, do not worry mon petit cher, we will put in your correct body by the time the carbonation process starts.

Randy relaxes and Quaid walks forward carrying the teleporter.  "Okay, Hunter, er Randy? whatever, just hold still, this shouldn't hurt, much."  Quaid presses the teleporter against Randy's stomach, and the world begins to dissolve.

Goddamn it, another body switch.  This one feels like the right one, but why is he strained?  Hunter struggles against the straps.  The table begins to swing his head upwards, and soon, if his feet had been on the ground, he would have been standing.  Vanessa stands in front of him.  The clean white of the carbonation room gives her a halo.  She always looked like an angel to him.

Tears are streaming down her face, "Hunter Strong, how date you invade the body of a prepubescent child genius in order to run a drug smuggling ring after I told you that I love you!"

"But, baby, I did it all for you.  I did it all for your father's operation."

"Hunter, you have to tell me everything.  You have to repent for your wicked ways, and pay for your crimes against humanity! And then, perhaps, then, we can be together."

"Alright, it all started when I was a little boy, my dad owned a smoothie shop."

"Smoothies! Why do those delicious creamy beverages cause so much heartache against time AND space?"

"I don't know.  All I know is the smoothies drove my dad mad.  He started as a franchisee, but he couldn't stop drinking the damn smoothies.  All I did was love you and want to get back at the Smoothiekings!"

"What did you do with Randy Smoothieking, Jr?"

"He must be back in his own body with the Kingpin and 3 billion credits of orbital weed.  He's in a better place."

"Where is the kingpin now?"

"If I tell you, the whole thing will go south.  Randy will die."

"What will happen to Randy if you don't tell us?"

"Probably die, so I guess there's nothing to do."

"South it is, where are they?"

"Detroit"

Vanessa wrinkles her brow, "I should have known, Detroit!  Wait, Detroit, Earth, or Detroit, Beta 365."

Hunter slams his hand against the table, "Detroit Beta 365, the worse place on earth!  That's where the Kingpin runs her operation.  No law enforcement goes there.  It's too terrifying.  Too dangerous.  You have to send me.  I'm the only one who can get in there alive, me and Chase, one more time."

She throws herself at Hunter, "It would be such a terrible end for you, being sent to Detroit!"

"Baby, I can take it."

"But Chase.  He has escaped and is framing Maxwell."

Hunter rolls his eyes, "Don't tell me he's hooking Maxwell up with the Archduke?"

Vanessa backs up, nodding her head and swiping the tears from her eyes, "He said Maxwell wants to make the sex with Franz and then assassinate him."

"At first I was down with Chase's plan of getting Maxwell to have sex with powerful people in history, and then killing them, because I hate the Smoothiekings, but no, this will destroy Europe, it'll destroy the timeline.  We must stop Chase.  I want to help!"

The Agency Head appears from nowhere that Hunter can notice, "The only way you are going to Detroit is in carbon.  You are going to Correctional Facility 12."

Vanessa lets out a shrill scream, "Oh no, not correctional facility 12!"

The Agency Head nods in slow, menacing oscillations, "Yes, he will never see the light of day again."

Chase is gasping for air.  He fumbles for his keycard, random things dumping out of his pocket until he finds it.  The safehouse door slides open into a pocket in the wall, and he steps across the threshold in one smooth, quick motion.  The door slides closed behind him and he collapses to the ground.

He has always thought that Betty could have been a grandmother in a movie.  She fits the part so perfectly with his curly white hair, and the flower-print apron she is always wearing.  Today is no different as she rounds the corner.

"Oh Master Chase, is everything okay?"  Chase waves his hand in the air, his lungs working overtime to deliver the much needed oxygen.  "You certainly look like you could use a shower."  She helps him up.  With the support of her body, he dumps himself onto the oversized recliner just passed the entry way.

"Betty, I'm leaving for a while."

"Oh, Master Chase, shall I pack your clothes then?"

"No Betty, the plan, it's falling apart.  The agency, they know, it's time for me to enact: Plan B."

"Oh very well, sir, should I make you a smoothie before you go?"

"That would be nice, Betty, thank you."  She stands up, and makes her way out of the room with soft shuffles of her feet.  Chase stands up once she has left the room, and walks to his bedroom.  He pulls out a small backpack from the corner of the closet, his bug-out bag.  He quickly changes his shirt, not that anyone could tell the difference between the black teeshirt he just took off and the black teeshirt he just put on.

He leans into the closet again and spins the dial on the safe embedded in the floor and the door opens with a hiss.  Good thing Chase stole a personal time device from the agency months ago.  Time to stop Maxwell, once and for all.

As he leaves the closet, Betty is standing the doorway with a smoothie in hand.  "Here you go, sir."

Chase swings the backpack onto his shoulder, slaps the time device onto his wrist, and then crosses the room in two strides, grabbing the smoothie from Betty's liver-spotted hand.  "Thanks Betty.  If everything goes well, I'll be seeing you again.  If not, thanks for everything you've done for the Jambas."

He clicks the time device, and the room fades to black.

***

The blackness resolves into a well-appointed hotel room.  A man with a square head and upturned mustache is sitting on the edge of the bed, his pants hanging on a nearby chair, and his military tunic unbuttoned and flopped to the side.  His round belly pokes out and he is digging in his belly button.  When Chase appears in-front of him, he jerks himself up, his belly shaking with the sudden movement.  This must be Archduke Ferdinand.

"Oh, has heaven sent me an angel?"  His eyes caress Chase's body in uninvited and violating ways.

"I'm no angel, sir."

The man's mustache raises to one side, and his hand finds its way into his own underwear.  "Are you a Devil then?"

Chase rolls his eyes, "I am, yes, a Devil, here to warn you, someone will come to you.  Do not trust him.  He will want to put things in you.  Do not trust him.  The fate of all of Europe depends on it."

"I've a long parade route tomorrow.  How about we have a little fun?"  The archduke's hand moving rhythmically and he reaches his other hand out towards Chase, motioning for Chase to approach.

Chase walks closer, and slaps the smoothie into his hand, "Here, drink this.  It will, um, give you amazing orgasms."  The archduke takes a long, deep pull off the smoothie.  His eyes grow wide and he begins to shudder.  After a full thirty-seconds of spasms, the archduke drops to the ground.  The thud of his body hitting the ground reverberates against the large glass doors leading to the balcony.

Chase feels the archduke's neck, looking for a pulse.  He has to have one, but there is none.  Betty, that bitch.  "Fuck."

The Mayflower enters the atmosphere above Detroit Beta 365.  Maxwell Smoothieking is on the bridge of the ship, leg propped over the arm of the captains chair, leaning towards the side.  "Bring me the flash bangs."  He stands up, to add dramatic emphasis, "I've got a no-knock to serve against the city of Detroit."  When the city is within view, Maxwell screams out, "Launch the flash bangs! fire! fire!"

After the smoke from the flash bangs clear, the communications officer speaks up, "I have the Kingpin on the line, sir."

"On screen!"  The Kingpin appears on the viewscreen.  Her lipstick and eyeliner are a bright red, and her necklace is pulsing with a fiery light.  "Kingpin, Where are the drugs and where is my brother?"

A slow smile spreads across her face, "We have no drugs and if we have brothers, they do not want to be known.  We are just humble prostitutes.  And in Beta 365, that is perfectly legal, so away with you, Time Cop."

"I know you have my brother, Randy.  Now hand him over!"

"Oh, Randy.  Yes, he's with Tina."  She turns her head and calls behind her, "Tina, bring Randy here please?"

Randy's voice is heard from off-screen, "Busy!"

"Tina, now."

Tina, naked with a similar collar around her neck, but glowing blue, drags Randy into view, gripping his shirt collar right.

Maxwell's words are sharp, "Randy, if I find you are just shitting around."

"Did you see her tits?"

Tina grabs her breasts and moves them around, "10,000 orbitals."  The Kingpin shoos her away, and she disappears off the screen.

"The Smoothieking fortune can get you all the hookers and blow you could ever want, why are you getting in bed with the Kingpin?"

The Kingpin cocks her head to the side, "No, no, no one gets in bed with the Kingpin."

"Beam me up, and we can discuss it in private."

Randy is dematerialized from the surface, and appears on the bridge of the ship.  Maxwell flips the safety switch and missiles level Detroit Beta 365.

***

Maxwell and Randy exit the airlock of the Mayflower, and enter the recycled air of Time Cop Central.  Time Cop Central is in a temporal-lock.  It exists in a timeless position in the universe, at all times in history and in the future.  Maxwell finally grasps how convenient that can be.

When they enter the main station, a paradox alarm is sounding and the view screens are flashing red with the words "History Revision Detected: Archduke Frans Ferdinand was pointed by the Black Hand."  There is a general panic washing across the room as the historians struggle to trace the ramifications of the paradox.

"Why must he kill all my lovers?"

The Agency Head is marching right towards them.  His brow is knitted with a sharp, intense glare.  "Maxwell, this is your fault.  Your's and Chases.  Go fix it, now."

"Randy, I deputize you under the Authority of the Paradox Order."  Maxwell jogs towards the time machines, but the station begins to become translucent, dematerial.  "Quick, no time to lose, we need to get to 1914 before the station dissolves!"

A historian is yelling to the room, "A great war, Europe too devastated from that war, and the rise of the following war to start the time program.  Time Travel was never invented."

Someone else screams out, "Oh gods, we are going to not exist.  This place will not exist!"

Maxwell and Randy make it into the time machines, and activate them.  Randy says, "Smoothiekings to the rescue!" as they fade out of the station.

***

The smoke from the missiles' destruction clears as a strong wind blows in from the South.  A small vessel lays in ruins, its contents spilled out on the trash heap where the craft crash landed.  A slab of carbon in the shape of Hunter blinks mournfully, and then goes out.  The carbon dissolves, and Hunter's naked body left in its place.

He is conscious, but weak.  He hears the scurrying of feet along the trash, and as his eyes adjust to the light, he see twelve children surrounding him, carrying make-shift weapons, and clothed in tattered remnants of clothing.  They speak, but Hunter cannot understand them.

The move with menacing jabs of their weapons, circling around him.  He understands two words "fresh meat" as they advance on him.  He overpowers one that was carrying a large spear.  The children swarm him, and he does what he must to survive.

He leaves their twelve bodies in the trash heap, and sets out to find the Kingpin, grabbing a discarded raincoat on his way, to cover himself.

***

Maxwell materializes behind Chase in the archduke's bedroom as the moment that Chase is handing the smoothie to Franz.  Maxwell jumps at Chase, knocking him to the ground, spilling the smoothie onto the ground.  In an instant, Maxwell has a gun pointed at Chase's head.

"It's poisoned!"  Maxwell says between gasps of breath.

"Poisoned?  Betty, that bitch tried to poison me."

"Betty was employed by me.  She was a deep cover operative watching after the scion of the Jamba empire.  I never knew it was you."

Randy materializes next to the archduke. "So it's our fathers who have been pitting you against each other?"  Randy notices that the archduke's hand is still in his underwear, and steps away from the archduke.

"I wouldn't mind if my father was dead."  Chase sighs.

Maxwell's eyes light up, "We'd inherit their fortunes, and then we can merge our brands.  No one could stop us!"  His laugh is frantic and manic.

Chase smiles. "We can be the Jamba Kinds.  And we should pin all of this on Betty.  That bitch.  And… we could get back together?"

"As long as there is room for Franzy and Ronny."

"I'll never under your desires for old, powerful men, but as long as I don't have to be involved, sure why not."

Randy puts his arms around Chase and Maxwell, "As for my silence, I want to be the time cop captain!"  All three of them laugh.

"Chase, why don't you take Randy back to Time Cop Central.  I have a little diplomacy to attend to."

***

The reporter is a young man with blond hair, dark skin, and purple eyes.  He sits at the edge of the cryo-life-support chamber, peering through the clear force field at Maxwell Smoothieking.  His wrinkled body is a mere sliver of what it once was.  Only the cryo-life-support keeps his body alive.

"And this was, what, 3000 years ago?"

Maxwell's voice is ragged and quiet. "oh, there abouts."

"And what happened to Chase?"

Maxwell laughs which shakes into a cough, "Oh, Chase got what he deserved. I took his company, exiled him to the wastes.  The last time I saw him, he was shivering and naked on my door step.  I release the hounds on him."  Maxwell  presses a small button, and the chamber fills with a sparkling red gas.

"One thing you never told me is how you discovered the spice?"

"That, my dear boy, is simple, I didn't.  Hunter Strong did, but like all the others, he was stupid, and in the end, I took him out."

"Tell me about Hunter's life after this all happened."

"He married Vanessa after her father died, and they had a son.  They named him Randy.  It was a nice tribute to my brother."

"Oh yes, Randy Smoothieking.  From the history books, he became the most ruthless Agency Head in all of history.  I believe he was the author of the Paradox Accord."

"Ah yes, yes, he was quite effective at extinguishing all of my competition.  Very useful to have a band of time traveling thugs under your thumb."

"Thank you so much for your time, Mr Smoothieking.  It's been an honor to speak to you.  Is there one last thing you'd like to say to my listeners before we sign off?"

"The smoothies must flow."
