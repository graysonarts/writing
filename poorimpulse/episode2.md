Tears begin to well up in Chase Monroe’s bloodshot brown eyes, and the words on the screen smear into incoherent blobs.  The smooth, plasticized fabric of his standard issue patrol gloves slide from temple to temple, clearing the tears, making the words distinct again.  The timestamps from the Time Master 3000 and the report logs from the Time Stream Dispatch show multiple unauthorized trips to Washington DC, United States of America, Earth during the 1860s Earth Coordinated Time.  Heat fills Chase’s ears and face.  That bastard is expecting to get away with this.  Chase punches up the Time Stream Dispatch’s control code, a flurry of symbols swarm on the screen.  He carefully arranges five symbols, a spiny seven point leaf, a family tree, a tall top hat, a spot light, and a symbol that defies description, but Chase knows that it means he and Maxwell will be assigned to this drug bust.  He clicks off the terminal and walks into the squad room of Time Cop Central. 	

The sun streams into the cavernous room, every surface drinks in the sun and spits it back out, a dazzling display of brushed metal.  The room buzzes with activity, and a few hoverbots zip in the upper echelons of the room in swarms that cause the sunlight to shift and shimmer as they pass overhead.  Maxwell Smoothieking is sitting at his desk, a low wooden workspace.  He sits on a half dome ball, slightly bouncing as he types into his terminal.	

Chase wades his way through the throngs of Time Cops gathered around a vidscreen.  As he makes his way through the edge of the crowd, a large roar erupts. Time Cops.  Chase shakes his head.  They could skip forward a bit to see who wins the galactic bowl this year.  He collapses into his own dome chair across the workspace from Maxwell.  Maxwell looks up, nods his head, and then goes back to his work. He could at least pretend to be cordial to Chase. He is the one who initiated the break up, after all, not Chase.  Moments later, a red light embedded in the workspace begins to glow.  Chase looks up at the same time as Maxwell.  Their eyes meet, and Chase raises an eye brow.  He resists the urge to reach across the desk and brush Maxwell’s blond hair out of his eyes.  Chase could never understand why Maxwell let his hair get that shaggy.	

Maxwell types on his terminal and pulls up the dispatch order, “It’s a case, Earth, 1865 ECT, 15th of April.”  Chase nods and pulls himself off of the ball, body heavy with fatigue. “You could sit this one out, Chase.”	

Chase shakes his head, “The head would have my head, let’s just get this over with.”  Chase walks back towards the galactic bowl viewing party, this time elbowing his way through the crowd with Maxwell on his heels.	

The deep thrumming of the Time Master 3000 reverberates through Chase’s skull, and his heart rate accelerates in time.  Hopefully Maxwell will be predictable, hopefully his shoot first, serve warrant attitude holds out. Maxwell steps into the frozen air of the time machine, and the acrylic doors, tinted blue, click into place.  Chase exchanges a glance with Maxwell, they draw their blasters, and Chase pounds his fist against the large red button.  The cold, damp air of the time machine dissolves into the warm, suffocating air of Ford’s Theater, the burning of the stage lamps, and the crowd of a thousand patrons all exhaling.	
	
Maxwell’s muscle tense, tossing a flash bang onto the ground.  The bright flash of light draws gasps from the crowd, and the lanky president is stunned, standing in rough, crazy motions, drawing Maxwell’s attention, and his blaster zips out, searing a hole in his iconic top hat, the smell of burning flesh and hair mix with the stale, dank air.  A scream from behind them echoes across the theater. Chase’s blaster silences it.	

“Mary Todd?  Oh God.”  Maxwell turns the top-hatted man over and tears well in his eyes.  He crumples down onto of the president.  “Oh my little Lincoln and your Lincoln log.  What have I done?”	

Chase stands behind, a small smirk on his face.  He toggles the small cylinder in his hand, flipping the safety cover up, and pressing the small blue light on the top.  His form begins to dematerialize, “President Fucker.”

* * *

Randy Smoothieking’s eyes are wide open, the green sparkle soaking in all the glory of Time Cop Central.  The gleaming metal, the commotion, and the periodic assault on his ears of the Time Master 3000s shuttling cops across time and space.  Blood rushes between his legs, and he adjusts himself.  Not now, stupid body.  “Wow!” escapes his lips, long and draw out, a small crack towards the end of the sound.	

Maxwell keeping pace, ushering him passed the security check point.  “Now, you can’t come with me on a mission, it’s too dangerous.”  He flashes his badge at the scanner, and leans into the retinal scanner.  “If we have a drug bust, you’ll just have to sit at my desk and wait for me to come back.”

“But Max!” he elongates the last vowel sound, a mild oscillation to the sound, dipping up and down in pitch.  Of course, Max won’t let him go on a drug bust.  He’s too overprotective.	

“No buts, Randy, you’ll stay here.”  They sit down at Maxwell’s desk, clean, orderly. He’s over compensating.  Chase sits down at the desk across from them.  Randy stares at Chase, digging holes into his face.  Maxwell’s quick nod towards Chase tells Randy all he needs to know.  Chase is still an asshole.	

“Let the kid go, Maxwell, it’ll be educational.”  Simultaneously, the computer monitors in front of Chase and Maxwell chime with the details of a mission.  Randy leans over Maxwell’s monitor and reads the screen.	

“The Mayflower?  We are studying that in school!  You have to let me go.  I’d get so much extra credit to be able to bring back pictures!  A first hand account!”  Randy is vibrating in his chair as he pleads with Maxwell.	

“No, you stay put.  It’s much too dangerous.”	

“Lighten up, Max. We’ll keep him safe.” Chase checks the charge on his blaster.  “I mean, it’s not like you’ve been fucking someone on the Mayflower, right?”	

Randy giggles and Maxwell narrows his eyes at Chase, “No, Randy, you stay here.”	

A tall man with wide shoulders, sharp features, and deliberately messy hair comes up behind Chase.  His smile is wide with gleaming white teeth.  Unnaturally white.  He holds a small, delicate looking device in his hands, wires jut out at odd angles, and there are a series of lights that blink with abandon.  “Maxwell, Chase.  I hear we have a drug bust on the Mayflower.  And who is this young tyke?”  The man extends his hand across the desk towards Randy, “I’m Hunter, Hunter Strong.  Best Time Cop in his agency.”	

Randy takes Hunter’s hand and shakes to in a violent sine wave.  “I’m Randy, Maxwell’s brother, and since it’s bring your sibling to work day, he was going to take me on the drug bust, weren’t you, Maxwell?”  His words are fierce and slide from one into the other.  Maxwell is shaking his head.	

“Ah Excellent, always great to show the next generation how a proper drug bust is handled.”	

“What’s that device, Sir?  It looks interesting, may I try it out?” Randy is reaching across the desk, hands reaching for the device that Hunter is holding.  As soon as Randy’s hands make contact, a high-pitched sound begins to squeal out from the device.  All eyes draw towards the sound.  Oh fuck.	

“No!” is the last thing Randy hears from Hunter’s mouth as the experimental teleporter sucks Randy and Hunter into it.	  Maxwell is on hit feet, grabs Chase by the collar, "We have to find my brother!  I'm not going to lose another sibling!"

Another sibling?  Chase raises his eyebrow as Maxwell is wrenching him out of the chair, the buttons of his shirt threatening to rip open. "How many siblings have you had?"  

Maxwell's hands are strong against the fabric clinging to Chase's shoulders, "No time for that, we must hurry to the time machine."

"It's a time machine, Max," but he is being dragged forward through the agency towards the time stations.

* * *

It is a weird feeling, being hurdled through time and space. It always feels off, just a bit, but this time, something is off, even worse, for Hunter.  He stands up, brushing himself off.  The dingy metal walls tower above him.  The dim light of the corridor throbs in time with a deep hum that is washing through his chest.  "Mayflower 1 - Corridor 673" is stenciled in glowing orange paint on the wall.

"The mayflower!" Hunter's voice is foreign to him, high pitched and tinny.  His hand finds it's own way to his face, but his fingers meet bare skin.  Where did his beard go?  And the dark, thick hair on his forearms.  And his forearm muscles. His heart pounds through his chest.  Space madness again? No, it can't be, not this time.

He stumbles forward, groping for the wall, foot connecting to something soft on the ground.  A groan, a familiar groan is emitted from the person on the ground.  Another time cop! Hunter rolls the other person over. His heart jumps from his chest as he stares at himself.  He backs away, eyes wide, back connecting to the corridor wall.

The other person rubs his face, hands frantically searching his jaw, pulling at the beard.  "What the hell?"  His eyes meet Hunter's, "What the fuck, why am I standing right there?"

"Randy?"

"What are you doing in my body?"

"It's Hunter, Hunter Strong, I think the teleporter switched our bodies."

"That impossible!"

"They used to say that about time travel."

"No, I'm… I'm… Old!"

"Yes, but you have amazing hair."

The sound of foot steps echo down the hallway, two sets.  A pair of men round the corner. They uniforms pressed crisp with a purple crown embroidered on the shoulder, Stormtroopers for the King Pin's operation.   The taller of the two men look at Hunter.  "Oi. Kid what are you doing out of the nursery."

"Piss off." Hunter looks at Randy and then remembers that he's the kid. The stormtrooper presses a small device against Hunter's neck, and the world fades out.

***

Randy's mind is racing a mile a minute as the guards haul his body down the hallway, back the way they came.  Time travel, drug busts, and now body switching. This adventure is awesome.  Randy nods his head at how amazing his school report will be after this is over.

"Hey, man, why are you just standing in the hallway, looking up at the ceiling."  A short Japanese man in pale blue overalls is standing next to Randy.  When did he get here?  "The best curse for the space blues is orbital weed."  The man holds out a small cylinder with a red glowing light on the end, offering the other side to Randy. 

Randy takes the joint and pulls it slowly into his lungs.  The burning invades his lungs, and he holds his breath as long as he can before letting out a harsh cough.  The Japanese man laughs and takes the joint from Randy.  "It's good shit, man, the King Pin don't fuck around."

Randy nods at the man whose face begins to spiral and wiggle in his view.  The room spins, and Randy holds onto the man.  Another hit, and the world takes on a magical feel of a low-res video game effect.  The hallway begins to flash yellow and red, and the peel of a siren assaults Randy.  His hands cover to deaden the sound, and a voice, mechanical, but female, sounds out over the intercom, "Time Cops inbound. Warrants to search vessel included.  Please comply with orders to avoid being terminated."

Maxwell and Chase materialize in the corridor next to Randy.  They are cartoon versions of themselves, large eyes with crazy large hair, and bad framerate. "Maxxie poo, Chase the Ace." Randy drips out, his words thick, tongue with a mind of its own.

"Hunter, where is my brother?"  Maxwell is grabbing Randy on the arms, shaking him, "Tell me where my brother is, now!"

Randy throws his arm limply around the back of Maxwell's neck, bringing his face in close to his, "I think they took him that way." Randy points down the hallway where the guards dragged his body.

Maxwell shakes himself from Randy's arm, grabbing Chase by the shirt sleeve again, "Come on, let's go het him!  Hunter, follow us!"  Randy begins to follow.  They round the bend of the corridor, and a giant beacon of glowing crisps stops him in his tracks.  The salty, greasy potatoes let out a siren song, the sweet odor draws him to the light, face pressing against the glass.

His hands fumble into his pockets, searching for his credit chip. His mouth floods with saliva, and the craving grows every second it is not satisfied.  He pulls the credit chip free from his pants pocket, and as he begins to swipe it through the vending machine's payment slot, the ship rocks hard, and Randy falls to the ground.

A new alarms burst out across the ship, and the mechanical lady screams out words that Randy cannot understand because they are not potato or crisp.  Maybe she's saying battle stations, but Randy can only stare at the glow of the vending machine.  The ship rocks a second time, and the glow is snuffed out as the machine crashes down on Randy.

***

The torpedo hits give Hunter the opening to get away from the guards, if only Randy's body would move.  Tranq pens are the worst, but Hunter's military training gives him a small advantage over his captures. As he concentrates, adrenaline is rushing into his blood stream, waking his limbs into action.  Before the guards can recover, Hunter is off sprinting down the corridor.  He takes turns unsure of his destination, and after three sharp turns down unknown corridors, he runs smack into a door that should have opened for him. Damn automatic doors, not always automatic enough.

He pounds on the control panel, and the door slides open.  His breath catches as he beholds one of the most beautiful sights of his life: a room full, from floor to ceiling, of orbital weed. He'll never be able to get all of this out with Randy's small body.  He looks around the corridor.  An escape pod catches his eye. A perfect way to get the orbital weed off the station before that do-gooder Maxwell shows up.  He begins carrying the bricks of orbital weed from the store room into the escape pod. He'll take as much as he can.

"You, boy, what are you doing?"  Think fast.

"The captain sent me to secure the goods in an escape pod?"

"Oh, brilliant idea."  The guard begins to help him move bricks into the escape pod.  Hunter notices the intergalactic universal communication device on the guard's belt.

"Can I borrow your IUC to make a quick call?"

The guard pulls the IUC off of his belt and hands it to Hunter. "Make it quick."

Hunter takes the IUC and nestles himself into the escape pod.  He enters the sip address for the King Pin into it, and presses it against his ear.  The guard closes the door of the escape pod behind him and begins entering information in the guidance computer.  Hunter hits the hang up button, and looks up at the guard.  "What did you just do?"

"We can't fit any more orbital weed in here, so I set the coordinates for Earth, so we can ensure this shipment of orbital weed gets back to Earth."

Hunter throws his hands up in the air. "No, we aren't going back to Earth."  Hunter stands up, and pushes the guard out of the way.  During the push, Hunter detaches the guard's blaster from his belt.  Better keep this safely away from the guard.  Hunter tries to enter new coordinates, but the nav computer splats an error tone at him, with large red text against a black background reading "Access Denied".  "Try your override!"

The guard punches some numbers into the console, but the same error tone blurts at them.  Hunter throws his hands up in the air, leveling the blaster at the guard. "You are no longer useful to me," and the guard's head evaporates into a fine mist.  Hunter returns his attention to the UIC, quickly hitting redial.

"Yo!" A gruff male voice on the other side of the sip connection.

"It's Hunter, Hunter Strong."

"Why do you sound like a twelve your old?"

"No time to explain that, There's an escape pod heading for Earth, you need to intercept it.  There is a dead guard in it, and a kid.  Dispose of the body, and take care of the kid.  Chase and I will rendezvous with you later, and get our payment for the orbital weed in the escape pod."

The UIC goes dead.  Hunter takes the blaster, and turns the power down, pressing the muzzle against his leg.  The trigger pulls back, and the pain is brief as Hunter fades out of consciousness.

***

When Hunter's consciousness returns to him, the pain in his leg continues, but it's different.  Hunter opens his eyes and sees the ceiling of the corridor. He sits up, the vending machine is pinning his leg to the ground. That's what is causing the pain.  Chase and Maxwell are standing at each side of the vending machine.

"Okay, one, two, three, lift!" The vending machine lifts off of Hunter's leg, and he quickly pulls it out from under the machine.  The pain is great. It must have broken his leg.  Chase is at his side as the machine crashes back down to the ground.  The instacast latches onto his upper thigh and expands, supporting the broken bone, pushing it back into place.  A series of needles extend into his leg, and after a brief moment, the pain disappears.  Hunter picks up one of the bags of crisps strewn about the floor.  With a loud crinkle, he rips the bag open and starts to eat the crisps.

Maxwell and Chase are talking, but with the alarm, and the crunching of the crisps, Hunter cannot make out what they are saying.  Reading their lips, "But the mustard was a fear." That's not working.

Four guards turn the corner, halting at the overturned vending machine.  Hunter stops chewing.  "Identify yourself.  You are not members of this crew."  They draw their blasters quickly from the holsters.

Maxwell pulls out his Time Cop badge, "We are Time Cops, and this vessel is being raided, for orbital weed!"

One of the guards presses a button on his shoulder, "Back up needed Corridor 674, We have the Time Cops, get down here quick!"

"Now now, we don't need to get hostile."  Guards pour into the corridor from both sides, blasters already drawn, safeties off.  "Let's talk this out!"

One of the guards shoots his blaster at the wall.  Probably just an accident, but all hell breaks loose, blasters and stun guns criss-cross the corridor, and Maxwell is hit by a stun bolt, and drops to the ground.

Chase is grabbing at the back of Hunter's shirt.  The world snaps back into clear focus, the drugs clearing Hunter's system as Chase withdraws the injection gun.  "Time to get out of here."  Chase drops down a chute in the wall.  Hoping it's a laundry chute and not a garbage chute, Hunter drops down behind him.

The air rushes passed as he falls. The descent is slower than he expected, force air pushes up the chute adding to the resistance as he falls.  At the end of the chute, his feet connect with a loud thud on the metal grate.

***

Mr X's patience is running out. It's been 30 earth days since the call from Hunter, and orbiting this close to Earth always makes him nervous.  Day thirty started off normal enough.  Protein synthetic mix, an injection of pure stimulant 891, 30 minutes in the muscle machine, and a little andorian holoporn.  What else are they supposed to do to pass the time?

And now, Mr X is sitting at the long range scanner console.  The rest of the crew is in stasis until the pod shows up, so he's taken to not wearing clothes. The blue glow of the view screens caress his dark naked skin, highlighting the undulating ridges of his abs.  The muscle machine sure is shredding whatever fat he had gained from the last mission.  His reflection in the blue glow of the screen is eclipsed by a small red dot appearing somewhere near his left nipple.

"Bingo."  He pulls his legs off the console, and leans in.  "Leland, engage the tractor beam, that escape pod is ours."

The computer bloops in response, and a purple haze envelops the escape pod, now visible through the forward windows of the ship.  Mr X pulls his gray jumpsuit from the navigation console and slips into it, sliding the zipper carefully up, avoiding catching any skin on the way up.  "Leland, awake the crew in prep for recovery."  Another bloop rings out.

***

Randy's eyes flash open and his heart pounds through his chest. A motley group of street thugs look down on him.  One man, his chest obscuring more than a third of Randy's view of vision smiles after Randy opens his eyes.  His voice is gravelly with a tinge of a British accent, "The young thing is awake."

Randy's leg is throbbing, but the pain that was there is only a muted shadow of it's previous self.  "Who are you? Where am I?"

A small black man smiles a broad, toothy grin, "I'm Mr X, and you are aboard the Valiant Stead.  Hunter asked us to take care of you."

"What?  What did Hunter Strong do?"

"You must be a bit touched in your head" The large man grunts.

"Do not mind Crusher Bob, he is more of a lover than a talker.  You are Hunter's new protege, yes?"  Randy nods his head.  What the hell, what does he have to lose.  "So he has told you all about the King Pin's plans, yes?"  Another nod. If nothing else, Maxwell could use this information.

"Of course, but, the trip must have scrambled my brains a little, how about you explain it again."

Mr X raises an eye brow.  "I do not think so, young sir.  The King Pin can tell you.  We are headed to the base now."

Crusher Bob moves in close to Randy and places a hand gently on Randy's shoulder.  "You'd make a good andorian sex slave, such smooth white skin." Randy steps away from Crusher Bob, moving the hand off of his shoulder. "It pays good money."

Mr X hits Crusher Bob with a small baton, "Leave the boy be, Crusher Bob, we do not deal in the sex trade.  Young Sir, let us go play a game of billion rings while the ship docks with the King Pin."

Randy is highly skilling at billion rings and quickly defeats Mr X.  After the third game of crushing defeats, Mr X leans back in his chair, half a smile across his face.  A throat is cleared behind Randy, and he stands, turning in place.

A tall, slim women with skin the color of the night sky stands a close distance in front of Randy.  The silver, highly reflective floor length gown hangs loosely on her slender frame.  She has a band of white makeup across her bright green eyes, and her lipstick is the same shade of green.  The sound of Mr X standing breaks the silence of the moment.  "Ah, King Pin, you have arrived."

"Hello, Mr X. And this must be Randy?"  She extends a hand.  Her fingers are long and graceful, topped with short razor sharp nails. They appear to be anodized steel implants, and they retract as their hands meet.

"Yes, ma'am, I'm Randy Smoothieking, nice to meet you.  Hunter Strong sent me." His voice cracks on "sent," and she smiles.  Hopefully she buys it.

"Smoothieking?  Now, Hunter used to talk about a Smoothieking.  What was his name? Dominic? Alexander?"

"Maxwell, that's my brother!"

She motions for them to sit again, and Randy complies, "And is he a time cop like Hunter?"

Randy nods his head, "Yes absolutely, one of the best. He's led so many drug busts.  I think he's set a record."

She narrows her eyes at him, "You sound proud of that."

He's blowing it, better act cool. "Sorry, I get excited. I mean, damn him, cutting into our drug trade."

She laughs, "quite right, young man.  You don't like your brother, right"

"Right, he's a bastard." Not too eager. "I mean, he's going to get the family fortune, not me, all because he was born first."

"And if we asked you to terminate your brother, would you?"

"That would mean I'd get the family fortune, of course I would." Yes, focus on the family fortune.

She steeples her fingers in front of her face, "Excellent.  How about some cocoa?  Children like cocoa, right?"  She snaps her fingers and Mr X jumps from his chair, running out of the room.

"Hunter isn't a very good mentor for you.  If you dispose of your brother for us, then I'll be your mentor.  Teach you all the ways of the business, and maybe some other things too, once you are a little older."  Her smile is sinister, but Randy nods in agreement.  "Now how do we get you back to Time Cop central?"

Mr X returns with steaming mugs of cocoa, and as they are drinking, Randy fumbles with the small teleporter device in his pocket.  If he can activate it, maybe he can warn Maxwell of the plan.

***
The whir of the time machine fades out, and Chase is standing on platform 8a at Time Cop Central.  Hunter is on the platform next to him, his eyes are wild, searching around.  Hunter says, "Where?  Where am I?  Oh Chase! I'm glad to have found you!" Hunter rushes over to him, clasping Chase's shoulders. "I have something urgent to tell you!"

Hunter doesn't normally act like this, except… oh no, not again.  Hunter continues speaking, "I'm Randy, Randy Smoothieking, and Maxwell is in danger!"

Chase sighs. "Hunter, no, you are Hunter Strong, best time cop in the entire agency, and you have" Chase pauses for a moment. "Time Sickness.  You get it every third time we do busts."

"No, Chase, you have to believe me, I'm Randy, and the King Pin wants me to kill Maxwell."

Chase takes Hunter by the shoulders, and turns him around, nudging him towards the door, "No, You are Hunter, it's time sickness again, come on, let's get you to medical, they'll straighten you out."

As they near the door, a woman blocks the doorway.  Her tall, imposing figure towers above Chase, and her blonde hair is transparent against the strong backlight of the hallway.  Her voice is thick with an accent, maybe it's French, maybe not. Chase never can place accents, but he knows her.  Vanessa Lululemon, agency psychologist, and Hunter's current side action.

"Time Sickness? Oh, It is not Time Sickness.  Believing he's the younger brother of your ex-lover can only mean that Detective Strong has… Time Madness."

"Doctor, It's Time Sickness, he get's it all the time."

"Excuse me, Sir, but do you have a degree in time pathology from Harvard?  I do not think so, now, I declare it Time Madness, which means, reconditioning!  Boris?" She calls behind her and a pudgy man with graying temples appears from the hallway.  "You know what to do."

He nods and quickly bows waddling towards them, and after a brief bit of fumbling, he presses an injection gun against Chase's neck.  That was unexpected, and Chase punches the man in the throat, and he collapses to the ground, still breathing, but having a hard time of it.

"Vanessa, what the fuck?"

"Just wait a moment while veritas 341 starts to work.  I have a few questions to ask you."  Chase's limbs begin to grow heavy and he sinks to the ground, collapsing into a heap beside the lab assistant who injected him.

"Now, let's make sure it is working.  Do you still love Maxwell?"

"Yes"

"Excellent, you are a double agent, is this correct?"

"No, not entirely correct."

"Hunter has been feeding me Intel for months now, unknowingly. He said that you and he work for the King Pin"

Hunter chimes up, "You too, Chase?  The King Pin is trying to kill Maxwell!"  Vanessa sighs, walks over to Hunter, and injects him with another injection gun. How many does she have?  Hunter collapses to the ground and goes silent. 

"I'll deal with him in a moment, Do you work for the King Pin?"

"Yes."

"And are these fake drug raids covering up something?"

"Yes."

"What are they covering up?"

"Maxwell has a fetish for powerful historical people.  I'm the jealous ex-lover, and I've been getting him to kill the men he's been sleeping with.  Lincoln, yes Lincoln was one of his.  And now he's moved onto Archduke Ferdinand, and I can't take it anymore!"  Chase's eyes cloud over with tears.

"Very well, it's time to get the agency head in here, and have him decide what to do with you, and with Hunter."  She turns her back to Chase, approaching the console.  Chase, fighting through the weight of the veritas 341 pulls his gun up, setting it to stun, and shoots Vanessa in the back.  She collapses onto the console, and Chase drags himself out of the room.  The more he moves, the easier it becomes to move, and soon he's sprinting down the hallway and out of Time Cop Central.

***
Goddamn it.  The burn of the force field on Maxwell's finger tips cause him to wince.  He paces across the cell, looking around. The return control on his time belt is being suppressed by something in the cell.  If he can find it, he can return home.

The stomp of boots echo down the corridor and two guards appear next to the force field. "Hands on the circles, " one of the guards barks.  Maxwell places his hands on the red painted circles on the wall.  "Do not move, or we will use force."

The force field disappears in a flash of purple light, and the guards advance into the cell.  Control collars are attached to his arms and legs, and a hood throws his world into darkness. "I already know we are on the Mayflower, and I know the layout of the ship.  I'm Maxwell Smoothieking! I will not suffer these indignities!"

"What did he say his name was?"

"Maxwell Smoothieking!" Maxwell yells, the fabric absorbing the spit from his mouth.

The hood flies off of his head, and the restraints drop off.  "Mr. Smoothieking. I am so sorry. The captain wants to meet the time cops who infiltrated his ship, but he'll be overjoyed when he knows it's you.  Quickly."

The guards pace picks up, and then are jogging towards that Maxwell only assumes is the bridge of the ship.  After two lav-plat rides, they arrive at a wooden door that has "Captain Belvedere" in gold-tinted letters.  One of the guards, maybe the same one that put the hood on Maxwell's head, presses an ornate button, and a small song plays out, muffled by the door.

The door swings inward, and a man with a bright, youthful face opens the door, and draws his face into a frown.  "Why is the prisoner not in restraints?"  His voice is thin and high pitched.

Maxwell steps into the room.  The room is lavished in late 19th century harem decorations, flowing silks hanging from the ceiling, the haze of incense hangs in the air.  Maxwell spins on his heels with his hands out stretched.  "I am Maxwell Smoothieking, and I believe, you work for me."

The captain's eyes widen and his mouth hangs open.  "I thought you'd be taller."

"Be that as it may, you were careless with our drug shipment, and the Time Cops became aware of it.  I did my best to misdirect, but to no avail."

"I cannot believe I have THE Maxwell Smoothieking, scion of the Smoothieking Empire on my ship."

Maxwell waves his hand in the air, "No matter, fix me a drink, and I'll tell you all about what happened."  The captain's hurried steps carry him to the smoothie bar at the far corner of the room.  "The Green, with a hit of amp-up, and mix in some B12 too."

After the whir of the blender dies down, and the smoothie is in Maxwell's hand, he begins to recount the tale of the drug bust including details of his brother's disappearance, and Hunter and Chase's abandonment.

"My word, that is quite the tale, sir.  My ship is offered to you.  Where would you like to go?"

"To find my brother and exact revenge on Chase!"

"There was an escape pod that launched.  The sensors read two organic life forms, one alive and one wounded.  The readings could, in theory, indicate that your brother was the wounded one."

"Where is that escape pod destined?"

"Earth, according to the tracking computer, it never arrived.  It was captured by one of the King Pin's ships."

"The King Pin?"

"Yes, sir, I have a number of spies in the King Pin's employ, and Hunter Strong and Chase Jamba are under her influence."

"You mean Chase Monroe?"

The captain cocks his head to the side.  "No Sir, Chase Jamba, from my intel, he has infiltrated Time Cop Central as an agent of the Jamba Regency."

"Show me a picture of this Jamba Agent!"  The captain pushes up a picture of Chase Monroe on the view screen.  Maxwell's vision narrows to a pinpoint on Chase's face.

"Known Aliases: Chase Monroe, Chase Alexander, Chase Mymouth, and Chase Mi. Spelt M-I."
