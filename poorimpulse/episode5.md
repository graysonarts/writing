Chadwick slams the door to the interrogation room closed, palm of his hand rubbing his forehead where the coffee cup connected with his skull.  A lump has already begun to form.

He sits down on the bare metal table separating Kyle and Victor from Boris and places the coffee cup down on the table.  His movement is slow and precise as he picks up the carafe and pours a thin, steady stream of coffee into the mug.  He hands it to Boris as he begins, "Let's make this easy on everyone.  Just tell us where the red head is, and we'll go collect her, and you can go free."

Kyle puts up his hand in response to Chadwick's words, but Chadwick places his hand on Kyle's shoulder with a small pat.

"We only care about getting our sweet Isabelle back, that's all."

Boris looks around the room shaking his head, and then locking eyes with Chadwick.  Chadwick's shoulders slump forward, and he stands up, walking behind Kyle and Victor, a hand on each shoulder.  He hangs his head for a brief moment before raising it again, "I wanted this to be easy."  He squeezes Victor's shoulder, and then turns to leave the room.  The door opens and closes behind Chadwick as he steps out.

"Alright, brov." Victor stands up, "You might want to look away, this might get nasty."  Victor leans over the table, grabbing Boris' hands which dwarf his own. He wraps a hand around one of Boris' fingers, and pulls back on it.  Boris' eyebrow arches up as Victor struggles to break the finger.  Kyle stifles a chuckle as Victor releases the finger, breathing heavy.  "Right."  Victor leaves the room for a moment, returning with a bottle.

To describe this bottle as an abomination of taste and decency would be doing it justice.  The pink and white Swarovski crystals that infect the bottle sparkle under the harsh florescent light of the interrogation room.  The word "Alize" in flourishing letters are sprawled against the bottle.

Boris looks at it and then looks back at Victor, "What?"

"Oh, you are going to drink this."

"And this is, what? Punishment?"

"Let's call it, advanced interrogation techniques."

Boris snorts a laugh towards Victor, "Bring it, tiny man."

Kyle's face contorts, "How is this possible going to help?"

"Brov, this shit is naf."  Victor dumps the coffee onto Boris' lap, and pops open the bottle of Alize.  The mix of over-sweet fruit syrup fills the room as Victor backs his face away, pouring the vodka into the coffee cup.  The places the cup under Boris' nose. "Drink."

Boris keeps his mouth shut, and shakes his head.  After a brief moment, Boris gasps, filling his lung with the acetic fumes of the Alize.  Victor upturns the cup into Boris' open mouth.  Violent coughs ensure as the Alize trickles down Boris' neck.  As the violence subsides, Boris' eyes are wide and frantic.

"Alright, brov. minging, innit? spill it, or ya get a second cup, right?"

"Fine. Antonska and Kolya will be at an old iron works factory.  It is our meeting place.  Just keep that swill away from me."

"Thank you."  Victor presses his lips against Boris' while grabbing the back of his head.  Kyle shakes his head, and Victor pulls away.  Victor smirks at Boris and exits the room, with Kyle on his heals.

 Riley and Chadwick are sitting opposite each other in the kitchen, eyes locked, faces straining.  Kyle and Victor enter from the hallway.  Kyle's voice is soothing, "we have a lead on the remaining Zolotovs.  Riley, gear up the lads?"
 
 Riley hops off the counter top, and walks out the nearest hallway, and returns a brief moment later.  He tosses a watch at Kyle, "X-ray scanner in watch form.  Managed to finally get it working.  Might come in handy seeing weapons or something.  It's millimeter wave, so if nothing else, you can look at people's junk."
 
 He then tosses a pair of socks at Victor.  "Radio-jamming socks.  Click your heel together to turn it on and off. I also have a small emp device in the toe, but, well, it uses an explosion, so it might hurt.  Not really tested that part, so I'd avoid using it, but the radio-jammer is solid."
 
 He twirls a cane in his hands, and then chucks it towards Chadwick, aiming for his head.  Chadwick catches it, and turns it around.  "Anything special about this?"
 
 Riley nods, "Yeah," Chadwick is inspecting the tip of the cane, "don't!" Chadwick pauses with his hand hovering over the tip, "It's a taser cane.  All you have to do is touch that end on someone, and bam!" He hits the counter top to punctate, "down for the count."
 
 Chadwick smiles, and twirls the cane in his hand, and then thrusts it at Riley.  His body spasms, and drops to the ground.  "Nice work, Riley."  Chadwick steps over Riley and picks up a cup from the counter.  Victor walks over and pours some Alize into the cup, and Chadwick drops it next to Riley's head.  "Shall we?"
 
 Kyle shakes his head. "Chadwick, you need to be nicer to him."
 
 "He had it coming."

 The Audi is zooming down the M4 under Kyle's deft hands.  The iron works factory is well outside of the city.  Boris had describe it as a safe house, a place to rendezvous and lay low when the heat gets too hot.
 
 Chadwick is sitting in the front passenger seat, and Victor in the back behind Kyle.  The traffic a heavy but moving, and Kyle zips between cars, making steady progress through the traffic.  The Audi pulls along side a silver and black Citroen convertible with the top off.  Victor's eyes lock on Nicholay's face.  They exchange recognition before Nicholay swerves into the Audi.  Metal on metal scraping blast their ears as Kyle fights to maintain control.
 
 Kyle's window explodes inward as a bullet pierces the car.  Their eyes trace the line of the shot, and Anton is standing up from the passenger seat, gun trained on them.  Kyle looks at Chadwick, and unclips his firearm from his shoulder holster, and hands it to Chadwick.  He presses the sunroof button, and pops his torso out of the sunroof, feet unsteady as the Citroen bashes into the Audi again.
 
 Chadwick steadies the gun against the roof of the car, and aims for the tires of the Russians' car.  The shot goes wide, hitting the tire of another car, causing it to spin out.  The Russians plow through the struck car, causing it to spin further into the barricade.  Another shot, this time shattering the windshield of the Citroen, glass raining down on them.
 
 Victor throws his backpack onto his back, and kicks open his door.  The door swings open and he shrinks back into the car as the Citroen comes in for another body check, ripping the door off its hinges.  It flies away behind them, and a cacophony of horns and swerving tires rise up in reaction.
 
 Victor perches on the edge of the car, and waits for the right time.  Another shot is fired from above, and Victor jumps out of the Audi.  His jump is timed correctly, and he lands with a soft thump in he back seat of the Citroen.  Anton turns around, gun swinging into Victor's face as he pulls the bottle of Alize from his backpack.  "Drinking is alot better than fighting, innit?  Pull this jam over, go back to mine, and get lit?"
 
 Anton continues to hold the gun at Victor who is shaking the bottle of Alize.  Nicholay speaks up, "Antonska, put the gun down, the little man is funny."  Anton lowers the gun, and Nicholay takes an exit off the M4, pulling into a small pub's parking lot.  The Audi pulls in a brief moment later.  By the time Kyle and Chadwick walk up to the Citroen, The Russians and Victor have drinks in hand.  They all exchange looks as Nicholay gets out of the car.
 
 Chadwick's motions are a blur as he sticks Nicholay with the tip of the crane, swinging around and hitting Anton through the car window.  Victor raises his cup of Alize, "vashe zrodovye!"

 All three of the Zolotov brothers wake with an intense headache, each in an individual cell in the bowels of LOGIC's field office below St John's Smith Square.  As they begin to stir, Victor stands up, addressing them, "Alright, brovs, two choices, tell us where Isabelle is, or drink the vodka I left in your cell."
 
 Anton sniffs the cup, "Pickles?"
 
 "Yeah, brov."
 
 "That is a violation."
 
 Anton breaks first, the smell of the pickle vodka making him queasy.  He details the way they are hired and where they made the exchange.  He spares no details as his brothers add additional context and information about the exchange.
 
 Victor leaves the brothers, walking with loud, clomping foot falls up the stairs.  The bottle of pickle vodka dangling from his limp arm.  Riley is perched in his customary spot in the kitchen, and Victor offers the bottle to Riley.
 
 "No thanks, I don't drink."
 
 "What?"
 
 "I don't like alcohol."
 
 "What? This stuff is pickle, yeah? You from Chicago, innit? Try it."  They volley back and forth and eventually Riley relents, downing half the bottle of the pickle vodka.  "Yeah, brov, you getting proper lit."
 
 Riley stumbles off the counter as he tries to walk back to his lab.  Victor helps him up, and takes him over to a computer terminal.  Chadwick and Kyle come into the lab from a hallway, in a deep discussion.  "And Ms. Thornhill wants you both to start training immediately.  Victor, come here, we are going to practice firearms."
 
 Victor and Chadwick take turns shooting at targets in the shooting gallery.  Chadwick is a crack shot, writing "Riley Sux" in his last target.  Victor's shooting is more erratic, and the wall behind the targets has a few new holes after the shooting contest.
 
 Riley has propping himself up with his arms, trying hard to remain standing.  Chadwick comes over and puts the target with "Riley Sux" up to his face.  "Just for you, big boy."  Riley's arms flail out in front of him, landing on Chadwick's shoulders, burdening Riley's weight on him.  Chadwick pushes him into his chair, and slaps the target into Riley's chest.
 
 "Great shooting! Now Victor, what did you find out from the Zolotovs?"
 
 "Right, so this bird, Casey or something, hired them to get Issa, and they dropped her at the tower of London, whitehall.  In front of the chopping block."
 
 "Riley, hack into CCTV and see if you can kind the exchange."
 
 "Yes, Sir" Riley's words are slurred, and he begins banging on the keyboard.
 
 "Are you drunk, Riley?"
 
 "Yeah, brov, he's proper lit."
 
 Riley shakes his head, "No..."
 
  "For fucks sake, Riley."
  
   "It's my fault, innit?" Victor pulls Kyle's attention away from Riley. "Right, no clue what they want of Issa, but we find the bird, she can lead us, yeah?"
   
    Kyle nods and Riley lets out a whoop, "Got her."  Riley pulls up an enlarged view of a woman with short cropped black hair wearing a black ball cap, pacing back and forth in front of the chopping block used to decapitate Henry the VIII's wives.  "Running facerec."  A few minutes pass as the progress bar on the screen fills up.  A ding sounds out, "Matched.  Cas-Caskiya-"
    
"Kseniya Mirinov. She is the boss of the local Russian cell here."

Chadwick leans in to get a better look at Kseniya's face, "She's quite fit."  Riley touches the side of Chadwick's leg, and Chadwick backs away, looking at Riley, "Drunk bastard."

Riley smiles up at Chadwick, and goes back to typing on the computer.  "MI-5 records show she works at the tower, pulling up current schedule."  His fingers fly across the keyboard.  He pauses for a moment to take a sip from his coffee cup, "She gets off work at 10pm tonight."

"Brilliant! Let's go get her."
