Chadwick slams the door to the interrogation room closed, palm of his hand rubbing his forehead where the coffee cup connected with his skull.  A lump has already begun to form.

He sits down on the bare metal table separating Kyle and Victor from Boris and places the coffee cup down on the table.  His movement is slow and precise as he picks up the carafe and pours a thin, steady stream of coffee into the mug.  He hands it to Boris as he begins, "Let's make this easy on everyone.  Just tell us where the red head is, and we'll go collect her, and you can go free."

Kyle puts up his hand in response to Chadwick's words, but Chadwick places his hand on Kyle's shoulder with a small pat.

"We only care about getting our sweet Isabelle back, that's all."

Boris looks around the room shaking his head, and then locking eyes with Chadwick.  Chadwick's shoulders slump forward, and he stands up, walking behind Kyle and Victor, a hand on each shoulder.  He hangs his head for a brief moment before raising it again, "I wanted this to be easy."  He squeezes Victor's shoulder, and then turns to leave the room.  The door opens and closes behind Chadwick as he steps out.

"Alright, brov." Victor stands up, "You might want to look away, this might get nasty."  Victor leans over the table, grabbing Boris' hands which dwarf his own. He wraps a hand around one of Boris' fingers, and pulls back on it.  Boris' eyebrow arches up as Victor struggles to break the finger.  Kyle stifles a chuckle as Victor releases the finger, breathing heavy.  "Right."  Victor leaves the room for a moment, returning with a bottle.

To describe this bottle as an abomination of taste and decency would be doing it justice.  The pink and white Swarovski crystals that infect the bottle sparkle under the harsh florescent light of the interrogation room.  The word "Alize" in flourishing letters are sprawled against the bottle.

Boris looks at it and then looks back at Victor, "What?"

"Oh, you are going to drink this."

"And this is, what? Punishment?"

"Let's call it, advanced interrogation techniques."

Boris snorts a laugh towards Victor, "Bring it, tiny man."

Kyle's face contorts, "How is this possible going to help?"

"Brov, this shit is naf."  Victor dumps the coffee onto Boris' lap, and pops open the bottle of Alize.  The mix of over-sweet fruit syrup fills the room as Victor backs his face away, pouring the vodka into the coffee cup.  The places the cup under Boris' nose. "Drink."

Boris keeps his mouth shut, and shakes his head.  After a brief moment, Boris gasps, filling his lung with the acetic fumes of the Alize.  Victor upturns the cup into Boris' open mouth.  Violent coughs ensure as the Alize trickles down Boris' neck.  As the violence subsides, Boris' eyes are wide and frantic.

"Alright, brov. minging, innit? spill it, or ya get a second cup, right?"

"Fine. Antonska and Kolya will be at an old iron works factory.  It is our meeting place.  Just keep that swill away from me."

"Thank you."  Victor presses his lips against Boris' while grabbing the back of his head.  Kyle shakes his head, and Victor pulls away.  Victor smirks at Boris and exits the room, with Kyle on his heals.

 Riley and Chadwick are sitting opposite each other in the kitchen, eyes locked, faces straining.  Kyle and Victor enter from the hallway.  Kyle's voice is soothing, "we have a lead on the remaining Zolotovs.  Riley, gear up the lads?"
 
 Riley hops off the counter top, and walks out the nearest hallway, and returns a brief moment later.  He tosses a watch at Kyle, "X-ray scanner in watch form.  Managed to finally get it working.  Might come in handy seeing weapons or something.  It's millimeter wave, so if nothing else, you can look at people's junk."
 
 He then tosses a pair of socks at Victor.  "Radio-jamming socks.  Click your heel together to turn it on and off. I also have a small emp device in the toe, but, well, it uses an explosion, so it might hurt.  Not really tested that part, so I'd avoid using it, but the radio-jammer is solid."
 
 He twirls a cane in his hands, and then chucks it towards Chadwick, aiming for his head.  Chadwick catches it, and turns it around.  "Anything special about this?"
 
 Riley nods, "Yeah," Chadwick is inspecting the tip of the cane, "don't!" Chadwick pauses with his hand hovering over the tip, "It's a taser cane.  All you have to do is touch that end on someone, and bam!" He hits the counter top to punctate, "down for the count."
 
 Chadwick smiles, and twirls the cane in his hand, and then thrusts it at Riley.  His body spasms, and drops to the ground.  "Nice work, Riley."  Chadwick steps over Riley and picks up a cup from the counter.  Victor walks over and pours some Alize into the cup, and Chadwick drops it next to Riley's head.  "Shall we?"
 
 Kyle shakes his head. "Chadwick, you need to be nicer to him."
 
 "He had it coming."
