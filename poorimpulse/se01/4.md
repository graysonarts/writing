"The bar must not be too high," Chadwick turning his palm up in Riley's direction. "This one let our key witness get away.  Good thing we were here to clean up his mess."

Riley stands up from behind the server, a patch cable dangling from his mouth.  He removes it, "Hey, she pulled over on Thornhill too.  She knew how to use her," his fingers make air quotes, "assets to her advantage."

Chadwick and Victor exchange looks, and then Victor steps towards Riley, giving him a pat on the back that sends Riley lurching forward.  "Got any new toys?"

A smile creeps across Chadwick's face, "yeah, the cane was pretty effective when I used it on you."

"Yeah. I had to throw out that pants because of you, asshole."  He tosses Victor a pair of sunglasses.  "I'm still working on it, but remote detonated explosives activated by the sunglasses."

He walks across the room to a small cabinet.  Keying in a code, the cabinet hisses open.  Riley retrieves a small bag and pulls a quarter size marble out of it.  "These are the explosives.  Clear and easily concealable, but deadly, if placed right.  But remember, radio signals, so they won't work with Victor's socks activated."

He drops the sack of marbles on the desk next to Victor.  "All I've had time to work on, with the office relocation and all."

"Excellent work with the time allotted, Mr Price. Ms Thornhill has another assignment for us.  This time from outsourced from the Department of Homeland Security, through our midwestern branch.  They are a bit strapped right now, so they asked us to intercede.  Simple drug raid operation, really."

"Yeah? Get the sample the wares, right?  That's fuckin brilliant."

"No sampling, Victor, Methamphetamine is a horrible drug.  Mission briefing is here."  Kyle hands the folder to Riley, "And Riley will be leading this mission in my absence."

Chadwick mouth drops open, "In your absence? Riley in charge? Do you want to get us killed?"

Riley opens the folder, and reads for a moment, and then closes the folder, "Okay, so, like, I'm in charge?"

Kyle nods, "Yes, Riley, but please do take care, show Ms Thornhill that her trust in your abilities are not misplaced."

"And they have to do whatever I tell them to?"

"Riley, a good leader sets the heading, and trusts in his crew to take the correct actions."

"Yeah Riley, we aren't going to suck you of or anything like that."

"What– What are you talking about, I don't–" Victor grabs the folder out of Riley's hand.

"Right so, it's an entire town cooking up the meth?"

"That is what our contacts at the DHS believe, so get yourself some guns, get down to the airfield, you have a jet operating under a diplomatic license waiting for you.  That will take you to Des Moine, Iowa, and Orientation is a short drive outside."

"Right, let's arm up, and get these meth bastards, brovs."

"Riley, I believe Victor will require the most garish guns in the arsenal, and I would like something with a larger than normal amount of rounds."

Riley's mouth turns up at one side, "Fine, we confiscated some guns from this douche Italian operative a while ago, serial number filed off, re-rifled so the casing can't be traced either.  They are suitably garish."  He runs off down the hall, disappearing around a corner.

"Brov, the kid's roger for you."

"Boys, lay off of him. Especially on this mission."

"We are getting separate rooms, right?"

Riley reappears from the corner with a small duffle bag.  The bag sags in the center, the square bulges of magazines pressed into the fabric by the guns above.  With a quick jerk up, the bag rises and thuds down on the table.  The ripping our of the zip opening bounces around the room.  The shine and shimmer of two gold-plated desert eagles dazzle Victor and Chadwick as Riley hands the guns to Victor.

"Like I said, suitably garish."

Kyle chuckles, "Those are rather fitting.  Well, boys, I must take Isabelle to our safe house up north.  God willing, I will see you when you return."  He walks out of the large room.

Riley turns to Chadwick, "since you seem to be hung up on size, I believe I have something for you also."  He reaches into the bag, and pulls out two less impressive guns.  "Tec-9s, not the biggest gun, but they do make extended magazines for them.  As well," he pulls out a round cylinder from the bag, "a 72-round drum magazine."

Chadwick's hands dart out, fingers wrapping around the proffered gun and magazine.  He speaks through his large, toothy grin, "Brilliant."

***

"This is some straight up James Bond, shit, brov."  Victor's hands rub the white leather of the airliner's forward seats.

Chadwick shakes his head, "Have you never flown in a Legacy 600 before?"

"Nah, Brov, this is my first time flyin, yeah?"

"We should probably work out our plan when we get into town."

Chadwick leans back in his chair, sinking into the leather, "Okay, boss man, what do we do?"

"Um, I…"

"Yeah, that's what I thought, not a clue, and they put you in charge?"

"Alright brothas, how about this.  Chaddy is the money, I'm the face, and dickspits the nerd.  We go in like we want to set up our own operation, and are going to the best in the biz to do it right, yeah?"

"I mean, that sounds like a good plan?"

"Hey Vic, looks like dickspits okay with his new nickname."

Riley puts both hands up to his head and presses in on his temples, running his hands through his hair, "Not really, but whatever."  He stands up and walks to the back of the plane.  He throws himself down on the bench seat located on the starboard side of the plane, covering his eyes.

Chadwick shrugs and mutters, "baby."

***

Orientation, Iowa has a single stop light in it, situated at a sharp turn in a local highway that goes unmarked for hundreds of miles at a time.  Their black Escalade kicks up a torrent of dust as they enter town, and pull to a stop at the stop light.  Riley turns on his right blinker, and pulls into the parking lot of the Dusty Fields Motor Inn.  The neon vacancy sign blinks on and off with an electric hum as they exit the SUV.

Riley pulls down his sunglasses and looks over the tops of them, "This place looks like it was taken straight out of a hitchcock movie."

"Don't go dressin' up like your mum, yeah?"

They enter the lobby of the motel, and trail a small stream of dust in with them.  "Fuckin' hell," Victor mutters as he takes in faux wood attached to every surface, heavy dark lines separating the panels attached to the wall.  A peg board filled with room keys hand behind the desk.

Chadwick nudges Victor in the side, and nods his head upwards, "Did you see the mural?"

Riley sighs, and walks up to the desk, the tinkle of the bell rings out as he presses the small silver button on the desk.  From behind a closed door, they hear the scraping of a chair against the concrete floor, and the door opens.

Riley breaths in deeply as the rim of a cowboy hat emerges from the room, followed up the forward edge of the man's belly, and then finally, the man.  "Yeah?"

"Three rooms, please?"

"We don't have queen size beds."

Riley's hands find their way to the bridge of his nose, and he takes another deep breath. "We'll take whatever you have, but please, dear god, please have three separate rooms."

"Yeah, we gottem, how long?"

Victor mutters, "About 25 centimeters," and Chadwick stifles a laugh.  Riley turns around, eye widening.

"No funny business, got it, this is a good Christian establishment."

Riley's lips become a fine line and has he closes his eyes and takes yet another deep breath, "No worries, sir, we're not–"

"I don't want to get into your business, son."

Riley drops a credit card on the counter, and the man swipes it up.  Moments later, he has three keys in his hands, and they are heading to find rooms 205, 206, and 207.   "Freshen up, and then we should probably start at the bowling alley across the street.  Meth dealers and bowling alleys seem about right."

***

By the time they are refreshed and reconvened in Riley's room, the sun has begun to set, and a strong wind has picked up, a certain chill carried on it.  The Seven Lanes of Heaven Bowling Alley and Pizzeria is situated across the street from the motel.  Chadwick's well-tailored suit collects a thin patina of dust as they exit the hotel and cross into the intersection.

It is a glowing beacon of light in the early evening light.  The edges of the building a traced in red and blue neon backed by shining chrome.  The building is rounded over at every corner, like a panel from a Gernsbacher illustration, an alien landing party out of place in time.

The din of bowling balls violently colliding with pins combined with country music playing on long-damaged speakers assaults them as they breach the threshold of the bowling alley.  As if in time with the music, the pungent mixture of stale cigarettes and breaded and fried things on sticks slam into them, causing Victor to cough, small pains shooting through his lungs.

The man sitting behind the shoe counter raises his head from his crossword puzzle at the sound of Victor's coughing.  Riley squints his eyes at the man, and then walks up to the counter, "Don't you work at the motel?"

The man's belly shakes in fascinating waves as the man laughs, "That's my brother, people say we look alike."

Victor walks up behind Riley, "Size 44 please."

"Only goes up to 12, son."

"Sorry, my friends aren't from the states, I believe size 44 would be 11s." Riley raises an eye brow and looks down at Victor's feet.

Chadwick steps to the other size, "and this kid," he claps his hand on Riley's shoulder, across his back, "doesn't need anything near that size."

"I'm a size 10, thank you."

"You wish.  I'll take 43s."

"He means 10s, also."

The man behind the counter turns around and drops three pairs of shoes onto the counter.   "If you want drinks or food, it's around back, behind the lanes.  Mac can get you want you need."
