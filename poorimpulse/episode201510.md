Jeffery Kushman is amidst a forest of pot, a spray bottle in his left hand as he checks the leaves and flowers of his crop.  The rhythm of checking the plants, misting, and then soothing his aching hands punctuates his path through the trees, the artificial warmth of the grow lights bathing his wrinkled skin in a warming clear light.

The brass bell above the front door of the Tongas Avenue Tanning Salon and Weight Loss center rings out as Mr. V, one of Jeffery's best customers, walks through the door, tanning lotion in hand.  Jeffery exits the back room of the tanning salon, slipping through the door, closing and locking it behind him.

"Mr V, right on time."  They exchange pleasantries as they walk towards the far tanning booth.  Mr. V closes the door behind them as they both enter the room.

"So, bro," Jeffery begins, "you here to score some of that diggity-dank?"

Mr. V kicks off his shoes, "I am, indeed, here to pick up some of that sweet, sweet dank."  He pulls his shirt over his head, his sagging pec muscles flop out of the shirt as the edge of his teeshirt pulls free.

"And you've got the money?"

Mr. V bends over, grasping an aluminum briefcase from his feet.  "Right here, if you are ready to make the transaction."  He holds the briefcase up to his chest and pats it.

"Excellent, Excellent," he proclaims as he shimmies out of his dingy white briefs, kicking them to the corner.

The door cracks open, and a boy sticks his head through the door.  The bright exuberance of youth glints in his eyes."

"Umm, Hey Timmy, Umm."  Jeffery stammers.

"Hey man, put that away, no one needs to see that!" Timmy steps through the door.

"This is my private tanning booth, Why are you even here, little Timmy?"

"Still need you put that thing away, I'm just looking for my pop-pop."  Timmy turns to Jeffery.

"Yeah Mr. V., au natural tanning isn't acceptable around my grandson.  Seriously Timmy, go man the damn front desk."

"But it's boring! I'm bored."

"I have a delivery for Mr. V while he's tanning, for his home tanning bed.  Tanning bed parts.  Let me go get them."  Jeffery exits the room in a hurry leaving Timmy and Mr. V standing in awkward silence.  Mr. V stands with his arms folded, glaring at Timmy.  Timmy looks around the upper corners of the room, avoiding the deeply wrinkled folds of Mr. V's naked body.

Jeffery reappears through the door carrying a small suitcase with a large lock on it.  "Here, Timmy, go take this out to Mr. V's truck, putting it in the bed of the truck."

Mr. V reaches out for the suitcase, "No, No, I think I can take care of it myself."

Timmy pulls the suitcase from Mr. V's hands, "I can handle this, just finish your tan."

Jeffery picks up the aluminum briefcase from where Mr. V placed it, handing it over to Timmy, "And put this behind the front desk."  Timmy grabs the briefcase and rushes out of the door.

Once outside of the tanning booth, Timmy shakes his head, "Old man dick is so gross."  With hurried steps, he walks to the front desk and deposits the briefcase behind the desk, and heads outside, the bright August sun blinds him as his eyes adjust.

Officer Mills is sitting in his patrol car outside of the tanning salon.  Officer Mills is only a few years older than Timmy, having just graduated from the police academy.  Timmy waves to Officer Mills as his eyes adjust.

Stepping out of the cruiser, Officer Mills approaches Timmy, eyeing the suitcase, "What you got there, Timmy?"

Timmy raises his shoulders up high and lets them drop languidly back down, "Dunno, tanning bed parts, or something, pop-pop gave it to me to bring outside."

"How about you open it up and show me what's in it?"

"It's locked, don't have the combination."  Timmy rolls his eyes, "Don't you have something better to do than harass me?"

"Listen you little shit…"

"Woah, woah, don't get all bitchy.  Are you really still butt hurt about me kicking your ass two years ago?  I was a better fucking skip than you, buddy, get over it."

"How about we go inside and talk to your pop-pop about what's in this suitcase?"

Timmy stomps his foot and spins in place, heading back inside, exhaling a loud, breathy exhale, "Fine."

Jeffery is sitting at the front desk, "Oh goddamn it, Timmy, um, Hello Officer Mills."

Timmy chucks a thumb back towards Officer Mills as the breaches the threshold of the building, "He wants to see the tanning bed parts."  Timmy holds up the suitcase.

"Could you open the suitcase for me, Mr Kushman?"  Office Mills places his hand on his gun.

"Oh, that suitcase doesn't have tanning bed parts in it.  That suitcase is full of Mr. V's personal effects.  Over the year, he keeps forgetting things here."

"Please open the suitcase."

Mr. V appears from the backroom wearing a white robe with Tongas Avenue emblazoned in green script on the back.  

"I can't remember the combination."

"Jeffery is pretty old," Mr V offers.

"Yeah, brains, these kind of details just fall through."

"So you are lending a suitcase, full of Mr. V's possessions for which you do not remember the combination?"

Jeffery nods with a tentative pursing of his lips.

"That's why I'm giving it to my good friend, Mr. V, so he can, um, work out the combination?"  Jeffery scratches his head, leaving red marks on circle of skin exposed on the top of his hair.  He runs his hands down the side of his head, straightening the fly aways from the graying pony tail at the base of his skull.

"It's probably your birthday, pop-pop, just like your pin code."  Timmy bends over and twirls the combination lock to 0518, and the suitcase latch pops open.

Officer Mills opens the suitcase, and bricks of pot spill out onto the ground.

"Timmy! What did you do with Mr. V's personal effects?  And where did you get this marijuana?"

"Pop-pop, you gave me this locked suitcase, I didn't do shit."

Officer Mills unsnaps the strap on his gun holster.  "Okay, sirs, whose suitcase is this?"

"Mr V's"

"Mr Kushman's"

Jeffery steps forward, "There really is no way of knowing, now is there?"

Officer Mills pulls his handcuffs from his belt, "Then I guess you are both coming downtown."  Officer Mills pins Jeffery to the front desk, clasping the handcuffs onto his wrists in jerking rough motions.

"Timmy, um, goddamn it, man the store."

Officer Mills leads Jeffery and Mr. V out of the store.  Timmy hops over the desk, and logs into Tumblr.

***

Timmy is sitting in the locker room.  His curling teammates are bustling around, flicking towels at each other, the youthful fervor of a great practice, fills the room.  Timmy's movements are slow and deliberate.  By the time he wraps a towel around his waist, the locker room has cleared out.

Coach Vance, a middle aged man with graying temples is leaning back in his chair, magazine spread open in front of him.  He whistles to himself, the noise echoing through the locker room, as the room quiets.  Timmy stands, bare feet slapping against the tile floor as he approaches Vance's office.

"Coach, there is a group of tourists coming into town today, I heard about it on the radio this morning, something about the northern lights."

Vance drops his magazine into his lap.  His eyes travel up and down Timmy's body as he nods his head.  "And?"

"What we should do is tell them the best place to see the lights is on your fishing boat.  We know the perfect spot."

"I like the way you think, Timmy my boy, get 'em away from the city lights."

"Yeah, right, and we can charge them $500.  Tell them something about it being a rare northern lights event, they are closer to the earth."

"Alright, alright, but how can we get more money out of them?  Tourists." Vance erupts with a hearty laughter from deep in his stomach, the muscles of his stomach shaking his entire body, shaking his head.

"I could grab some parkas, and say, you know, since the lights are closer to the earth, there is radiation danger, so, like, the parkas are to protect you from the radiation?"

Vance nods, his hand drifting to his stomach, digging into his belly button, picking out a piece of lint.  "So $500 per head, plus the parkas for, what? $500 more?  $1000 a head, get 10 suckers, um, I mean tourists, that's a pretty penny."

Timmy nods enthusiastically, grabbing the edge of his towel as it begins to slip.  "Exactly, there coming in at seven tomorrow night, so you have the boat ready, and I'll get the parkas.  Can you front me the cash for those?"

Vance shakes his head, "boy, go take it from your grandpa's til, you can replace it the next morning.  Heard he finally got popped."

Timmy eyes drift down to his feet, and he shifts his weight between them, "Yeah, okay."

Vance stands up, closing into Timmy's personal space, but Timmy backs up, clearing the doorway, "I'll put up some signs, drum up some referrals from the hotels."

Timmy nods, expanding the distance further, "Yeah and we'll call ourselves," his hands perform a sweeping motion in time with his words, "Northern Exposure!"

Vance laughs, walking out of the locker room as he calls over his shoulder at Timmy, "Lock up when you are done."

***

The sun is just barely cresting over the horizon, an expanse of ocean that is clear and blue with a small sliver of  land, swallowed up by the glare of the sun.  The crimson and orange hues paint a single fishing boat, bobbing about on the rolling waves.  The words "Totally catching tuna" are scrawled across the stern in hand painted lettering.

Vance and Mr. V are hauling a heavy net onto the deck of ship.  A single dolphin struggles against the net, and its weight is making progress slow, and tedious.  Between sharp intakes of air, Vance stammers, "We are going to need to cut the trip short today.  The boat needs some, um, repairs."

Mr. V pauses the progress of his side of the net, "What repairs?  Boats working fine."

"Just, you know, routine maintenance, gotta fix it before it breaks."

"Yeah sure, what part are you going to work on?"

"The engine?"  Vance pulls the dolphin onto the deck and it flops around.

Mr. V takes a spear off the wall of the cabin, and stabs the dolphin twice until it stops flopping.  With heavy breaths, "Do you want some help?"

Vance pulls the net off of the dolphin and begins to cover it with a tarp, "Nah, nah, no, it's all good, just boring, routine, tedious work.  It's easy, just takes a while."

"You sure? I rebuilt the engine last summer"

Vance secures the tarp onto itself, "Nah it's okay, you take the afternoon off.  I heard about your trouble yesterday."

"Oh yeah, That little Timmy, his pop-pop needs to give him a good wooping."

"He is a bit rambunctious."

"I hope, for his sake, when he graduates, he gets out of here and never comes back."

Vance laughs, "Yeah but then he'll end up all liberal minded and come back here to try to change us."

Mr. V steers the boat back towards town, turning into the sunrise.  They make their way to the dock over the next hour in silence.  Vance busies himself with gutting portioning out the dolphin, tossing identifying parts over the port side gunwale of the boat.  In total, the one dolphin filled five ice chests full of meat.

As they dock, Vance calls into the cabin, "Can you take the map with you, you know, to keep it safe?"

Mr. V stares at Vance for a moment before responding, "Sure, but why? it's perfectly safe here."

"Oh you know how clumsy I can be.  I'll get grease all over it, or something.  Just take it home, and bring it back tomorrow.  Oh, and take the tuna too, because I'm going to get to work on the engine immediately."

Mr. V shuts off the engine of the boat, nodding, "Yeah sure, We have a buyer today, so I'll just do the exchange."

Vance nods.

"Help me load these ice chests into my truck." 

Vance nods again, grabbing two of the ice chests, stepping up onto the dock, a hesitation of his steps causes him to stumble before the boat rocks, helping him catch his footing, and hops onto the dock.

A Yugo, aging, sun-bleached yellow paint, pocked full of rust holes, slides to a stop at the end of the dock, and Timmy jumps out, running down the end of the dock to Vance.  "I got all ten of them!"

Vance face goes pale, "You, you are a little early, Timmy."

Mr V emerges from the boat, plopping one of the ice chests down onto the dock, pulling himself up to standing. "Oh, look, it's the little shit."

"Have you met Mr. V, Timmy?"

Timmy waves, "Oh yeah, he got busted with my pop-pop."

"Ten of what, exactly?"

Timmy, face beaming with pride, "Parkas!"

"In August, what do you need ten parkas in August for, little Timmy?"  Mr. V's shoulders come forward, leaning in towards Timmy, fists clinched at his hide.

Vance steps forward to put himself between Mr. V and Timmy, "It's some training I've heard about.  Get them really hot, make them practice really hard, then when it's competition time, it's like easy play."

Timmy nods his head with frantic motions, "Yeah it's like those space suits they used to wear in the 80s."

Vance smiles, "Yeah, just like that!"

Mr. V narrows his eyes at Timmy, and then at Vance, and then returns to Timmy, "The curling rink is on the other side of town.  Why are you bringing parkas to the docks?"

"I told him to meet here, so that, uh–"

"Damn, you caught a ton of tuna today!"

Mr. V lets out a sharp quick exhale, "GMOs, look, didn't you flunk biology?  Do you even know what a tuna looks like.

Timmy bites his lip and nods his head in an imperceptible way.

"And it's not like you've ever been fishing.  Your pop-pop seems pretty against you coming near the boats anyway.  To you a tuna looks like a can you buy at the store.  So why don't you leave those parkas here, and get."  Mr. V pushes his way passed Vance, standing tall over Timmy's short frame.

"Yeah, why don't you load the parkas into my car, here, let me help you."

***

Jeffery's clothes are stained with sweat as he sits in the backroom of the tanning salon.  The long drag on his bong leaves him coughing as the bell of the front door rings out.  He puts the bong down gingerly on the bench next to him, and walks to the front of the store.

Timmy is putting money into the til as Jeffery appears from behind the door.  "Timmy, what the hell, are you stealing money from me?  And why did you send me to jail, man?"

Timmy pushes the til closed, "Jail was not my fault.  I didn't know what was in the suitcase."

Jeffery slams his hand against the counter, "You could have assumed!"

Timmy's forehead creases, "Why? Because you have a bunch of pot plants back there?"

Jeffery nods furiously, "Yeah, that would be the chief reason!"

"Whatever, and I'm not stealing from you, I put the $800 that I borrowed back into the til."

Jeffery jumps over the front desk, pushing Timmy into the wall, "What is this endless stack of cash you seem to have?"

Timmy struggles against his grandfather's strong arms, "There's other ways of making money in this town."

Jeffery's face is so close to Timmy's that the smell of his unbrushed prison teeth causes Timmy to gag, "You better not have sold any of my goddamn pot, I swear to god."

"I don't touch that stuff, they drug test us on the curling team.  Coach Vance would kill me."

"If you've got a money making scheme, you better cut pop-pop in."

Timmy's struggles against Jeffery subsides, "I don't think I need any more old men involved in this."

"What other old men, Timmy, what are you getting up to.  Tell me!"  The back of Jeffery's hand connects with Timmy's face, the flesh slapping rings out, echoing off the glass windows of the store front.  "Where did you get this money?  You better not be whoring yourself out."

Tears are streaming down Timmy's face as he kicks Jeffery in the nuts, causing him to double over in pain, freeing Timmy from his clutches.  Jeffery's face flashes red, the pounding of his heart drowning out all other sounds.  The rage flies out of him as he begins to punch Timmy in the face.  Timmy falls to the ground as Timmy curls into the fetal position, "I swear to god, Timmy, I will beat you back into your mother."

Out of breath he snatches the money bag from Timmy's hand, "I'm going to keep this safe for you.  Pop-pop will invest it for you.  Now man the goddamn desk."

Sobbing, Timmy stands up, fighting against the pain, as Jeffery turns back to the pot room door.  Timmy picks up the cash register, throwing it through the plate glass window of the store front.  The rain of glass shards tinkle to the ground, the sound and reflected light dance across the space as Timmy bolts out of the building, into his yugo, and drives away.

Jeffery stares, mouth agape, at the large hole in the store front.  "Goddamn it."

Timmy drives straight to the dock where Vance and Mr. V are loading up the boat for an evening's fishing trip.  Timmy slams to a stop at the end of the dock and runs up the dock.  Vance sees him, "Mr. V, how about you go get the engine ready, and I'll take care of this."

Mr. V nods, and climbs down into the boat, disappears from sight.

"That fucking old man has gone crazy! Look what he did to my face!  It's my only good asset."  Timmy's face is swelling and discolored, his wet eyes glisten in lights of the dock.  He shakes as he talks.

"As your curling coach, at least you know the truth.  What happened?  Just calm down, and tell me what happened."

"I took the money from the til, like you told me to, for the parkas, and I was replacing it, but pop-pop was out of jail."

"Well yeah, he made bail."

"Oh, so he was mad about getting arrested, though not my fault, I didn't know what the fuck was in the briefcase, and then I took the money out, and then he started beating the shit out of me because he wouldn't take no for an answer for where I got the money.  I don't want to be anywhere near that psychopath.  Can I come on the boat with you?"

"Do you even know how to swim?  Isn't that why you are on the curling team?"

"At least I can doggie paddle, plus, life vests, come on."

Mr. V calls up from the boat, "No fucking way that kid is coming on my boat, and I'm not going to double cross my dealer."

Timmy leans over the dock, "It's not like he's going to stop selling to you.  You're his best customer from what I can tell."

Vance leans over too, "Don't you know old Jeffery from way back in the day?"

"Yeah you were in 'Nam together, he's not going to cut you out."

Vance looks pleadingly at Mr. V, "Come on, the kid is obviously scared, and look at his face, look what his pop-pop did to his beautiful face."

Mr. V sighs heavily, "Vance, come fix up the map," he nods towards the cabin, "And Timmy, there is a life vest at the end of the dock, can you go grab that and put it on?"

Timmy nods and jogs to the land as Vance climbs down into the boat.  The engine purrs as Mr. V pulls away from the dock, leaving Timmy holding a life vest.

***
Vance's footsteps strike heavy on the cement as he slams his door and walks into the tanning salon.  Jeffery is sitting behind the front desk, talking on the phone.  When he sees Vance enter, "Hey, I have to go, yeah, the window is going to need replacement.  Yeah talk to you later."  He hangs up the phone.

"Coach Ford, what can I do for you?"

"Mr. Kushman, you can't go around hittin' your boy, you know that, right?"

"Who the fuck do you think you are?  Coming into my place of business and telling me who I can beat?"

Vance slams his hand down on the front desk, "It's not my responsibility.  I have to go talk to the cops, and no one likes the cops."

Jeffery mirrors his words, "No one like the cops, that little piece of shit threw my register into the window!"

Vance smirks, "he's got a good curling arm."

"And what do you care, anyway?"

"Because now I'm required to go to the authorities and report this abuse.  My star curler looks like a piece of day old meat!"

Jeffery leans forward, lowering his voice into a growl, "And what if the authorities find out about all his little secret schemas he's running.  I'd assume you wouldn't know anything about that, huh Mr. Ford?"

Vance stands up straight, drumming his fingers on the counter, "Only scheme I know he's running is working here at this 'Tanning Salon'," he makes air quotes with his fingers.

Jeffery leans back in his chair, "Touché"

Vance smiles, "This extremely well lit tanning salon.  I do have an idea, maybe help us both out, a bit of a business proposition to expand your market a bit, if you promise to stay your hand more with Timmy.  Keep the cops out of this."

Jeffery nods, "I'm listening, but I can't promise anything, that damn kid.  But I'm not interested if Timmy's involved, he's going to fuck it up.  Inevitable, man."

Vance leans in, "you are probably right, but here's my idea.  Occasionally, Timmy's been helping me out with some sightseeing tours, you know, show tourists the sights."

Jeffery nods, "that's where he's getting that fat stack of cash, from sightseeing tours?"

Vance winks and nods his head, "These city folks, you know what city folks get up to."

"I know the type."

"They probably would enjoy some of your non-tanning products."

Jeffery smirks, "I think we could broker some type of arrangement."

Vance rubs his hands against his cheeks, "We can use Timmy to mule the products."

Jeffery puts his hands up, "Let me tell you, I've tried that.  Not a great drug mule.  I do not feel safe with Timmy being involved.  I think I'm going to lay low.  I'm feeling the heat after this latest bust.  I don't think arranging to work with scoundrels like you is in my best interest."

Vance crosses his arms across his chest, "Scoundrels?  I'm just doing tours for city folk."

"You keep Timmy out of trouble.  I'm not interested in any of your schemes, buddy, and if I see Timmy around you, I'll beat you both so bad.  You go and get.

Vance walks out of the salon through the empty window, as Mr. V pulls up in his truck.  They exchange a brief glance as Vance gets into his truck and drives away.

Mr. V hops out of his truck and walks into the salon through the empty window.

Jeffery throws his hands up in the air, "Would people stop doing that!  We have a door!"

Mr. V hunches over the desk, peering at Jeffery, "I'm here to pick up the delivery Timmy fucked up.  I paid you, I know the cops took it and shit, but I never got my goods.  So you need to mosey on back into that backroom and find what I need."

Jeffery puts his hands behind his head and leans back against the wall, "Yeah, that's not going to happen, my friend.  You know the rules."

Mr. V glares, "I know the rules, so I'll need my briefcase of money back, then."

With a smug grin on his face, "I'm sorry, I don't think I can do that either.  You know the rules of the road."

Mr. V leans in further, "You know, little Timmy has been coming around alot more often lately. It would be a shame if there was some sort of accident, that could have been stopped if only I had my briefcase back."

"That horse won't run.  I can't confidently say Timmy encountering an accident wouldn't benefit my life."

Jeffery pushes himself off the back wall, "You come into my tanning salon, you try to extort me.  You threaten my idiot grandson.  You walk through my plate glass window.  You have no class, sir!"

Jeffery grabs a dime bag from under the counter and flings it at Mr. V, "Here, keep the tip, you filthy animal."

Mr. V looks at the dime bag, "Really?"  He lets out a heavy sigh, picks up the brochure rack, and tosses it through the other plate glass window.

"Motherfuck!"

Mr. V strolls out through the newly opened window, "Have fun reporting that to the cops, buddy.  Explain to them why I did it."

Jeffery calls after him, "yeah I'll explain what your tuna is too, asshole."

***

The swelling of Timmy's face has lessened in the last day.  He dismisses questions from the rotation of tanning customers that have been streaming in and out during the day.   The vacant apathy in his eyes discourages people from pushing the issue, and he wiles away the time looking at facebook on his laptop.

Jeffery enters, eyes glued to his shoes as the bell of the salon chimes up.  Timmy's jaw clenches and he winces.  Jeffery puts his hands quietly on the desk, intertwining his fingers.  "My heart hurts, Timmy."  Timmy's eyes drill holes through Jeffery's bloodshot eyes.  "Pop-pop lost his cool."

Timmy says nothing.

"Now Timmy, I need you to tell me, exactly, what you are getting up to with your coach."

"Well, he doesn't beat the crap out of me, for starters.  He actually cares about me."

"Timmy, that coach hasn't done anything untowards with you, has he?"

Timmy rolls his eyes, "What we do is not untowards."

"Timmy, you tell me, and tell me now."

Timmy slams his laptop closed, "Fine, you want to know what we do?  Tourists are idiots!  And holy shit, do they have money, so we take them on tours, and sell them overpriced fake shit.  We make a killing!"

Jeffery sighs heavily, "I know, Vance told me already."

"Then why did you ask?"

"We need some truth between us, so now I have some truth for you.  Vance asked me to provide refreshments for your guests."

"Great.  Can I go now?"

***

Vance is scrubbing the side of the boat, smears of red turning pink and running into the water with every pass of his sponge.  Mr. V at the fore of the boat, untangling a large fishing net.

Timmy trots down the dock, towards Coach Vance.  When Vance sees him approaching, he slops the sponge back into his bucket, and jumps onto the dock.  They meet a few feet from the boat.

"I told pop-pop everything, but then, so did you."

Vance nods, "He can't do that to you."  Vance reaches his hand out to Timmy's face, fingers gentle against the bruised flesh, turning his head to the side.  "It'll heal though."

Timmy backs away from his hand, "Yeah, it's fine.  Pop-pop is willing to offer the pot to the tourists.  We just need to find a way to transport it to the boat."

"You can bring it in your gym bag.  Your pop-pop didn't take kindly to that, but it's the only way.  Go tell him that I'd like to meet later this afternoon, after we get back from fishing."

Timmy nods and turns around and heads back down the dock as Mr. V is climbing up off the boat onto the dock.

"What did that little shit want?"

"Oh, nothing.  Curling crap."

A skinny man with glasses comes running up the dock wearing a heavy sweater, and shapeless cloth shoes, "Ahoy, Captain!" he hollers towards the boat.  Vance and Mr. V turn around and stare at him.

The man comes to a skidding stop, breath heavy with excitement. "I had the best time a couple of months ago."  Mr. V eyes narrow, darting between Vance and this new man.  "The northern light tour was amazing.  I hear there is a special one, something about a rare event?  Are you going to run another tour?"

Mr. V's eyes are a fine line of incredulity, "This is a fishing boat, not a tour boat.  I think you have it wrong."

"No, no, the boat was called the 'Totally Catching Tuna'," he responds, pointing at the stern of Mr. V's boat as Mr. V shakes his head.

"No, Captain Ahab, here," pointing to Vance who puts his hands up and shakes his head in response, "took me out.  You have to remember me, Captain?  We took all those selfies together."

The man pulls out his phone, flipping through his gallery of selfies, "See, there is the protective parka they sold me, it kept me safe from all the radiation," he continues flipping through pictures of the boat, Vance, and the other guests, "Oh, and here is one of that nice young man who sold me the ticket and the parka," He shows Mr. V a picture of Timmy giving the peace sign.

"Goddamn it, little Timmy.  Well, sir, there are no tours any longer, and no rare event happening.  Go back to your hotel."

The man hangs his head, shaking it as he turns around and walks off the dock.

Mr. V's face is solid red, "What the fuck have you been using my boat for, Vance?"

"Okay, okay, we've been running tours.  Calm down," Vance adds distance between him and Mr. V who is shaking.

"I'm not going to calm down, you, you are done with this fishing operation."

"Wait a second, let's not be rash here."

Mr. V steps forward, finger pounding into Vance's chest, "Don't be rash?  Don't be rash?  You've been stealing from me!  That scam sounds great, but I deserve a large cut.  It's my boat!"

"It's not  very profitable."

"Bullshit.  If it wasn't, you wouldn't be doing it."

Vance takes another step backwards, his heels hitting the edge of the dock, "It's not enough to cut you in."

Mr. V advances again, closing the gap, "Then I'll take 95%, and you can get 5%, and that little shit, Timmy, gets 0%.  Final offer, or you are out of the fishing business, out of the tour business, and if I ever see you again, out of life.  Got it?"

Vance nods.

"Meet back here at 5am with your answer, if you take my deal, show up.  If you don't, you better get the fuck out of town."

***

Mr. V's apartment is in disorder, with empty bottles littering every surface.  He is sitting out his kitchen counter, slumped over, an empty bottle of Jack Daniel's wedged in his hand.  "I'm going to kill that little shit," his words slur through the alcohol, as he pushes his free hand into the counter, wrenching himself up out of his chair.

The ground bucks and dips under his feet as he makes his way to the door.  "Little shit's going to die tonight."  His hand gropes for the shotgun hanging on the wall.  Fingers curling around the barrel, he slams the door on his way out.

The short distance to the tanning salon proves difficult as Mr. V swerves down Tongas Ave, empty of cars, a gentle fog beginning to roll in off the water.  The tires of his truck squeal with the slam of the brakes as Mr. V skids to a stop in front of the tanning salon.  Two large pieces of glass sit against the outside of the tanning salon, stacked together, the replacement windows for the store front.

Jeffery is sitting at the front desk, reading a magazine with Timmy to his side, working on homework.  They both look up with the sound of the squealing tires.

Mr. V stumbles out of the truck, slinging the shotgun over his shoulder.  Mr. V's eyes lock with Jeffery's eyes for a brief moment because Jeffery pulls a shotgun from under the counter.  Mr. V pumps the shotgun once, levels the shotgun as the windows, and pulls the trigger.  Glass rains down to the ground as the two panes of glass shatter into a million pieces.

Mr. V steps through the door, "Hey there, pop-pop, Here there little Asshole.  I hear you've been stealing money from me by using my boat for your little tourist scam."

Jeffery pumps his shotgun, "You come into my tanning salon, and threaten my grandson?  You take a step back motherfucker."

Mr. V's face takes on the hue of a tomato, "You and your little shit of a grandson have taken more than enough advantage of me.  You took my money, didn't give me my pot, and now your grandson is using my boat without permission.  You hit your grandson, beat him to a pulp, and now you are defending this little fucker?"

Jeffery points his shotgun at Mr. V, "No one abuses my grandson but me, buddy.  Now how about we get a little baked and talk about this like rational people?"

Mr. V shakes his head violently, "Fuck no, we aren't going to talk about this.  Timmy need to be taught a goddamn lesson."

Jeffery stands up, dragging Timmy up out of the chair, "Okay fine, how about you just knock him out with the stock of the gun, there, that'll teach him good, and now get the cops involved.  Can't have you shooting up my grandson."

Timmy tries to dislodge Jeffery's grip from his shirt, "Wait a minute!"  He struggles against Jeffery's hold as Mr. V raises the shotgun above his head.  The stock connects with Timmy's face, a dull crack echoes against the walls, and Timmy collapses to the ground.

Jeffery pours the last drip of the bottle of vodka into his glass, downing it in one quick motion.  A canister of gasoline sits next to him on the porch of his small cabin.  He stands up, grabbing the canister.  He looks over his shoulder into the window of the cabin.  Timmy is laying out on the sofa, ice pack resting on his head.

"Goddamnit Timmy, why do you bring so much trouble into my life."  He places the canister of gasoline into the bed of his truck, oozes into the drivers seat, and reverses with quick jerky motions down the driveway.

His path to the docks is not anything but straight, truck swerving into the oncoming lane repeatedly.  Officer Mills is sitting on the side of the road, and flips on his lights and sirens as Jeffery veers across an intersection, barely missing a parked car.

"Mr. Kushman, pull over, pull over now."  Jeffery shouts obscenities out of the window at the cop, half-intelligible.  Officer Mills pulls along side of Jeffery, continuing to order him to pull over, and when Jeffery does not step, he begins to force the truck off the road.

Jeffery overreacts to the side swipe from Officer Mills' cruiser, careening into a barricade.  The truck slams to a stop.  Officer Mills walks over to the truck, "License and Registration, Sir."

"Get out of my face, Bobby, I have a boat to burn down."

Officer Mills unclasps his service revolver from the holster, and levels it at Jeffery's face.  "Get out of the car, now, face down on the ground."

Jeffery opens the door, and pours himself out of the truck, stumbling onto the ground.  Officer Mills jerks Jeffery's arm behind his back, slapping a pair of handcuffs onto him.
