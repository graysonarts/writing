Jeffery Kushman is amidst a forest of pot, a spray bottle in his left hand as he checks the leaves and flowers of his crop.  The rhythm of checking the plants, misting, and then soothing his aching hands punctuates his path through the trees, the artificial warmth of the grow lights bathing his wrinkled skin in a warming clear light.

The brass bell above the front door of the Tongas Avenue Tanning Salon and Weight Loss center rings out as Mr. V, one of Jeffery's best customers, walks through the door, tanning lotion in hand.  Jeffery exits the back room of the tanning salon, slipping through the door, closing and locking it behind him.

"Mr V, right on time."  They exchange pleasantries as they walk towards the far tanning booth.  Mr. V closes the door behind them as they both enter the room.

"So, bro," Jeffery begins, "you here to score some of that diggity-dank?"

Mr. V kicks off his shoes, "I am, indeed, here to pick up some of that sweet, sweet dank."  He pulls his shirt over his head, his sagging pec muscles flop out of the shirt as the edge of his teeshirt pulls free.

"And you've got the money?"

Mr. V bends over, grasping an aluminum briefcase from his feet.  "Right here, if you are ready to make the transaction."  He holds the briefcase up to his chest and pats it.

"Excellent, Excellent," he proclaims as he shimmies out of his dingy white briefs, kicking them to the corner.

The door cracks open, and a boy sticks his head through the door.  The bright exuberance of youth glints in his eyes."

"Umm, Hey Timmy, Umm."  Jeffery stammers.

"Hey man, put that away, no one needs to see that!" Timmy steps through the door.

"This is my private tanning booth, Why are you even here, little Timmy?"

"Still need you put that thing away, I'm just looking for my pop-pop."  Timmy turns to Jeffery.

"Yeah Mr. V., au natural tanning isn't acceptable around my grandson.  Seriously Timmy, go man the damn front desk."

"But it's boring! I'm bored."

"I have a delivery for Mr. V while he's tanning, for his home tanning bed.  Tanning bed parts.  Let me go get them."  Jeffery exits the room in a hurry leaving Timmy and Mr. V standing in awkward silence.  Mr. V stands with his arms folded, glaring at Timmy.  Timmy looks around the upper corners of the room, avoiding the deeply wrinkled folds of Mr. V's naked body.

Jeffery reappears through the door carrying a small suitcase with a large lock on it.  "Here, Timmy, go take this out to Mr. V's truck, putting it in the bed of the truck."

Mr. V reaches out for the suitcase, "No, No, I think I can take care of it myself."

Timmy pulls the suitcase from Mr. V's hands, "I can handle this, just finish your tan."

Jeffery picks up the aluminum briefcase from where Mr. V placed it, handing it over to Timmy, "And put this behind the front desk."  Timmy grabs the briefcase and rushes out of the door.

Once outside of the tanning booth, Timmy shakes his head, "Old man dick is so gross."  With hurried steps, he walks to the front desk and deposits the briefcase behind the desk, and heads outside, the bright August sun blinds him as his eyes adjust.

Officer Mills is sitting in his patrol car outside of the tanning salon.  Officer Mills is only a few years older than Timmy, having just graduated from the police academy.  Timmy waves to Officer Mills as his eyes adjust.

Stepping out of the cruiser, Officer Mills approaches Timmy, eyeing the suitcase, "What you got there, Timmy?"

Timmy raises his shoulders up high and lets them drop languidly back down, "Dunno, tanning bed parts, or something, pop-pop gave it to me to bring outside."

"How about you open it up and show me what's in it?"

"It's locked, don't have the combination."  Timmy rolls his eyes, "Don't you have something better to do than harass me?"

"Listen you little shitâ€¦"

"Woah, woah, don't get all bitchy.  Are you really still butt hurt about me kicking your ass two years ago?  I was a better fucking skip than you, buddy, get over it."

"How about we go inside and talk to your pop-pop about what's in this suitcase?"

Timmy stomps his foot and spins in place, heading back inside, exhaling a loud, breathy exhale, "Fine."

Jeffery is sitting at the front desk, "Oh goddamn it, Timmy, um, Hello Officer Mills."

Timmy chucks a thumb back towards Officer Mills as the breaches the threshold of the building, "He wants to see the tanning bed parts."  Timmy holds up the suitcase.

"Could you open the suitcase for me, Mr Kushman?"  Office Mills places his hand on his gun.

"Oh, that suitcase doesn't have tanning bed parts in it.  That suitcase is full of Mr. V's personal effects.  Over the year, he keeps forgetting things here."

"Please open the suitcase."

Mr. V appears from the backroom wearing a white robe with Tongas Avenue emblazoned in green script on the back.  

"I can't remember the combination."

"Jeffery is pretty old," Mr V offers.

"Yeah, brains, these kind of details just fall through."

"So you are lending a suitcase, full of Mr. V's possessions for which you do not remember the combination?"

Jeffery nods with a tentative pursing of his lips.

"That's why I'm giving it to my good friend, Mr. V, so he can, um, work out the combination?"  Jeffery scratches his head, leaving red marks on circle of skin exposed on the top of his hair.  He runs his hands down the side of his head, straightening the fly aways from the graying pony tail at the base of his skull.

"It's probably your birthday, pop-pop, just like your pin code."  Timmy bends over and twirls the combination lock to 0518, and the suitcase latch pops open.

Officer Mills opens the suitcase, and bricks of pot spill out onto the ground.

"Timmy! What did you do with Mr. V's personal effects?  And where did you get this marijuana?"

"Pop-pop, you gave me this locked suitcase, I didn't do shit."

Officer Mills unsnaps the strap on his gun holster.  "Okay, sirs, whose suitcase is this?"

"Mr V's"

"Mr Kushman's"

Jeffery steps forward, "There really is no way of knowing, now is there?"

Officer Mills pulls his handcuffs from his belt, "Then I guess you are both coming downtown."  Officer Mills pins Jeffery to the front desk, clasping the handcuffs onto his wrists in jerking rough motions.

"Timmy, um, goddamn it, man the store."

Officer Mills leads Jeffery and Mr. V out of the store.  Timmy hops over the desk, and logs into Tumblr.

Timmy is sitting in the locker room.  His curling teammates are bustling around, flicking towels at each other, the youthful fervor of a great practice, fills the room.  Timmy's movements are slow and deliberate.  By the time he wraps a towel around his waist, the locker room has cleared out.

Coach Vance, a middle aged man with graying temples is leaning back in his chair, magazine spread open in front of him.  He whistles to himself, the noise echoing through the locker room, as the room quiets.  Timmy stands, bare feet slapping against the tile floor as he approaches Vance's office.

"Coach, there is a group of tourists coming into town today, I heard about it on the radio this morning, something about the northern lights."

Vance drops his magazine into his lap.  His eyes travel up and down Timmy's body as he nods his head.  "And?"

"What we should do is tell them the best place to see the lights is on your fishing boat.  We know the perfect spot."

"I like the way you think, Timmy my boy, get 'em away from the city lights."

"Yeah, right, and we can charge them $500.  Tell them something about it being a rare northern lights event, they are closer to the earth."

"Alright, alright, but how can we get more money out of them?  Tourists." Vance erupts with a hearty laughter from deep in his stomach, the muscles of his stomach shaking his entire body, shaking his head.

"I could grab some parkas, and say, you know, since the lights are closer to the earth, there is radiation danger, so, like, the parkas are to protect you from the radiation?"

Vance nods, his hand drifting to his stomach, digging into his belly button, picking out a piece of lint.  "So $500 per head, plus the parkas for, what? $500 more?  $1000 a head, get 10 suckers, um, I mean tourists, that's a pretty penny."

Timmy nods enthusiastically, grabbing the edge of his towel as it begins to slip.  "Exactly, there coming in at seven tomorrow night, so you have the boat ready, and I'll get the parkas.  Can you front me the cash for those?"

Vance shakes his head, "boy, go take it from your grandpa's til, you can replace it the next morning.  Heard he finally got popped."

Timmy eyes drift down to his feet, and he shifts his weight between them, "Yeah, okay."

Vance stands up, closing into Timmy's personal space, but Timmy backs up, clearing the doorway, "I'll put up some signs, drum up some referrals from the hotels."

Timmy nods, expanding the distance further, "Yeah and we'll call ourselves," his hands perform a sweeping motion in time with his words, "Northern Exposure!"

Vance laughs, walking out of the locker room as he calls over his shoulder at Timmy, "Lock up when you are done."
