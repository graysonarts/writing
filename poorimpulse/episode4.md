The fog barely lifts from Chadwick’s head as he sits up in the room.  Holy crap, the room is quite posh.  The floor-to-ceiling windows let in a stream of sunlight that sears into his eyes and he squints against it.  He stands up, ass bare to the world, and walks to the window, looking out.  Hyde Park? Stupendously posh.

He turns back to the bed.  The red haired woman is sprawled out across the bed, the sheet is the only slight bit of modesty afforded her.  He runs his fingers through his hair, and his exhale fills the room.  She begins to stir.  What was her name again?

He hurries to his clothes, slipping on his pants, followed by his shirt, all quick, practiced motions. Avoid the awkward morning has been his mantra lately.  As he leaves the main loft area, the sound of the shower running. Bloody hell, that must have been a great night, if only he could remember.

Chadwick’s bare feet pad across the polished bamboo floor of the hallway.  As his hand reaches for the door, Victor sticks his head out of the bathroom, black hair plastered flat against his head.  The towel wrapped around his waist is slipping down, and Victor catches it, holding it in place.  "Alright then? Popping off? Mind getting some coffee while you're out?"  His tone is affable.  Victor, always around when you least expect it.  The kid's got a knack.

"Goddamn it, Riley! I have to get going, just give me the bloody keys!"  Kyle's face flushes with blood and the urge to punch Riley's smug, American face boils up from somewhere deep in Kyle's gut.

"I'm under strict orders from Ms. Thornhill, all assets must be properly signed out.  Budget shortage and all."

Kyle turns around, walking out of the garage, "Insufferable twat."

Kyle's eyes take a moment to adjust to the strong light of the sun as he emerges from the tube.  He checks his watch, and his pace increases.  He weaves his way through the throng of people streaming out of Knightsbridge station.  Taking a chance, he dodges past cars.  A traffic officer blows his whistle at Kyle, waving his hands in erratic, haphazard motions.  Kyle smiles and waves, side stepping out of the way of a honking car.  The officer's eyes narrow, but Kyle is safe across the lane.

He nods to the doorman at the Rolex store.  One day, he'll be able to afford one, or maybe his barrister sister will get him one for his birthday.  Better start dropping hints now.

Moments later, he's standing face to face with the callbox at One Hyde Park.  "Now where is her number?" he talks to himself.  A woman in a black pants suit walks out the door, narrowing her eyes at him as she exits.  He smiles, catching the door to hold it open for her as she leaves.

He slips into the lobby as she turns her head to watch him, phone already to her ear.  He presses the up button on the lift five times, no more, no less, exactly five, and then puts his hands behind his back.  He rocks back and farther on his feet as he waits for the doors to open.

Victor is standing in the middle of the loft, having forgotten about holding the towel around his waist.  His olive skin prickles to goose-pimples as he processes what happened. The glass from the window litters the ground, and a cool wind is blowing in from the hole where the window used to be.

"What the fuck?"

The door bursts open, and Victor turns, locking eyes on the red haired man that kicked the door in.  His eyes meet the man's M9.  In quick succession, the gun is pressed against Victor's head, he's thrown to the ground, glass cutting into his naked body.  Blood hell, that hurts.  A litany of questions are streaming out of his man.

"Woah, woah, woah, I was just entertaining the young lady last night."

"Isabelle, where is Isabelle?"

"Get off me, geezer, there's glass cuttin' me john thomas."

Kyle lets Victor up, grabbing him under the arm and shoving him onto the bed.  Victor lands on his back, and then props himself up with his elbows. "Right, so last night we were getting proper lashed, me and my mate, Chadwick, and this right fit lass was chatting us up.  That was this Isabelle, right, so she took us back to her's."  he points his finger down, "And we copped off.  Not bent, mind, bit of an Eiffel tower, if you catch my meaning."

The back of Kyle's hand connects the side of Victor's head with a solid thump.  "That's my niece you are talking about."

"She was a bit of a hoover, if I ever seen one.  Right, so this morning, Chadwick was off gettin' coffee or whateva, and I was getting cleaned up, and next thing I knew, right brotha, window done in, and disappeared, smoke and then the bird flew away.  No idea what happen."

Kyle breaths to a count of ten, and then exhales.  "Right then, you're coming with me."

"I'm starkers, can I at least get a robe?"

Kyle nods, "hurry up, we have to find my niece."

LOGIC is located through a red door in the back of the cafe at the entrance to the concert hall at St John's Smith Square.  It's a convenient location situated near enough to Parliament and the Palace that when Jane Thornhill needed to make a request of the crown, she could do so in as little time as possible.

Today is not one of those days.  Today, Jane is pouring over accounting statements, trying make sense of the latest rash of defections from the organization.  She is wearing, like most days, a form fitting black suit with her black hair pulled into a tight bun.  A deep sigh, and she closes the lid of her laptop.  "Yes, Riley?"  Her voice is smooth and melodic, almost soothing.

She addresses the thin boy with shaggy blond hair like a mother would a child who is asking for a car. "I wish you'd reconsider my assignment.  I can do more than just make things.  I'm good in the field."

She steeples her fingers in front of her face.  "When you were transferred to my division, I asked for your progress and training records.  You are not suited for our type of field work."

"But, Ma'am, I've been working hard to–"

"No. Final word on the subject.  Did I see Kyle return from his lunch with his niece?"

"Yeah. I can't believe *he* is suitable for field work, and I'm not."

"Yes, his training scores are excellent. He's a very skilled negotiator, and his connections throughout this city as vast.  Quite appropriate for field work, let's move on."

Riley stands up, grabbing his jacket off the arm of the chair.  "He's brought someone back for questioning, I guess Isabelle was kidnapped."  He slams her door behind him.  She shakes her head, and then opens her laptop again.

Chadwick's hangover has been blunted by the pint he had before starting the journey east to Ilford.  The train cars are filled with the usual weekend crowd, the masses returning home or heading into the city for the day, and they are all insufferable to Chadwick.  He catches a glimpse of himself in one of the windows of the car as it goes through a short tunnel.  His hair is a wild mess, and in his rush to leave the flat, he forgot to put on his shirt, leaving only with his jacket.  He catches himself before he laughs out loud.

A man, about his age, is standing near by, and Chadwick keeps catching the man looking at him.  For a brief moment, their eyes meet, and the man smiles at him.  His white teeth contrast against his dark skin.  Chadwick turns away.  Why do they always have to hit on him?

Ilford station is run down and dirty.  Chadwick turns his nose up at the piss on the ground as he surfaces from the station. This is why Chadwick tries to never take a tube home, but Mr Barrow, his valet, did not answer when he called to be picked up.

His house is a short taxi ride from the station, but as Chadwick is hailing a taxi, he reaches into his pants to find that his wallet is absent. Bloody hell, did he get pickpocketed?  He waves the taxi away and continues to his house on foot.

Mr Barrow is a short man with graying temples, and is holding the door open for Chadwick as he walks up the path and into the house.  He immediately starts to shed his day-old clothes, handing pieces to Mr Barrow without saying a word.

Once full undressed, he pads his way upstairs, closing the door to the upper level behind him.  The bathtub fills with steaming hot water, and Chadwick crawls into it, submerging his head.  He holds his breath and stays under as long as he can before coming up for air.  He gasps as the water clears away from his mouth.

Victor needs to urinate, but the interrogation room is locked, and Kyle has not returned for the last hour.  The need to relieve himself grows intense as the seconds tick away.  He's pacing in the room, dancing, crossing and uncrossing his legs.  The pattern and motions repeat themselves.  He searches around for something, anything to use as a receptacle.  The coffee cup.  Yes, the coffee cup.

He unzips his pants, pulling his penis out, and unleashes a stream of urine into the cup.  He sighs out, the sound echoing in the room.

Kyle clears his throat, and Victor whips around, sloshing the urine onto the ground, penis still in hand.  Kyle and Riley are standing in the doorway.  Kyle looks down for a brief moment and then returns to Victor's face, "Mind putting that away?"

"Alright then, not like you haven't seen it before."

Riley turns to face Kyle, mouth open, "You've seen it before?"

"Shut up, Riley, he was naked when I entered Isabelle's loft."

"Oh," a brief pause before Riley let's out another "Oh" longer and more drawn out than the first, "I see."

Victor smiles and nods, "Yeah, brotha, you feel it."  He zips up his pants, and puts the cup full of urine on the table.  Kyle motions for him to sit, and they all sit around the table.

Victor repeats the story of what happened to Isabelle, and Chadwick's presence.  Riley leans over and whispers something into Kyle's ear.  Kyle nods, and Riley jumps out of his chair, and leaves the room.

Kyle stands up, pacing around the room, coming up behind Victor.  He pins Victor to the table with a strong hand, "Stop talking about my niece that way, or I will cut your bollocks off and feed them to you, through your arse."

Victor laughs, "How's that then?  Through my arse?  Not really feeding them, eh?"  Kyle punches Victor in the left kidney, and backs away from him.  Riley reenters the room, eyes darting between Victor and Kyle.

Riley tosses a plastic bag to Kyle.  It contains Chadwick's wallet, and Kyle shoves it into Victor's face.  "Calm the fuck down, K, I ran the ID.  Chadwick Worthington the third.  Records say you've helped him in the past."

"I did?"

"Yeah, says the douche bag got caught with fireworks or something shit, anyway, you kept him from going to jail, but his friends took the wrap."

"That sounds, familiar."

"Chadwick's a swell guy, my best mate, we'd be blinking, if we was bent."

Riley and Kyle turn to look at Victor, mouths hanging agape.  Kyle picks up the wallet, "right, we better return this to him, then."

"I can go with you, you shouldn't go alone."

"Sorry, Riley, Thornhill would do my nut in if I took you on fieldwork.  But Mr. Inkwell here, he can come since him and Mr Worthington are such good mates."

Victor stands up, "Let's go geezer."

The Audi Q7 pulls to a stop in front of the address on Chadwick's file.  It's a modest two story house with light tan brick, and modern accents of deep gray shingles.  The curtains are drawn on the upper stories, and the sound of a heavy bass line is rattling the windows on the upper floor.

Kyle takes off his sunglasses as he exits the Audi.  Victor slinks out of the car, and around the front, "Better let me do the talking, The valet might be hostile."

"Why would the valet be hostile?"

Victor shrugs and talks to the door, pressing the button on the side of the door.  Mr Barrow opens the door, and Kyle flashes his LOGIC badge, "If you could be so kind as to request the master of the house to speak to me."

Mr Barrow steps to the side and gestures for them to enter, "Please wait in the study while I retrieve Master Worthington from upstairs."

Victor steps in, "Thomas, you right cunt, make Mr Quinn a cuppa, and I'll fetch Chaddy-my-boy."

Mr Barrow puts his hand on Victor's shoulder, "I do not think that would be appropriate, sir."

Victor pushes his way passed Mr Barrow, and slips up the stairs with hurried steps, "Nah, broth, it's alright, we tight, just be a minute."
