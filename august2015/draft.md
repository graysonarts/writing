# Dominic

Dominic's life is not his own. The stories he tells are a lie. It has been this way for so long that he is becoming a master of believing his own lies, but this is how he makes his living.

The sun is starting to crest the top of Nakitashi Plaza, tracing a laser beam of searing light across his eyes.  Muscles tighten, fractions of a second, and slips out of bed, and begins to pad across the smooth tile floor. He turns back to confirm that Max is still asleep.  Max's form lifeless but for the gentle rising and falling of his breath, and the flutter of his eyelids.  Dominic muses about what dreams are playing behind those eyelids.

The apartment they share is small, not much more than a bedroom. They have a small bathroom, but the shower is down the hall, along with the shared kitchen. Smooth, white space-age polymer tiles cover the floor and walls.  The ceiling is exposed, expanded concrete, reinforced with a lattice work of steel ribbons.  This design was considered modern once.

Dominic shuffles into the bathroom.  Urine streams explosively into the toilet, the sound deafening in the silence of the morning.  He picks a pair of shorts out of the clothes hamper, and slides them on. He flushes and continues out of the apartment.  The only thing on his mind is coffee.  Until that happens, he's not really functional.

It's a religion, a ritual, an incantation. Power, Water, Grind, Fill, Tamp, Extract. It's the only truth he knows at this very moment. The liquid dark and syrupy, frothy golden head. Quick motions and it is down and warming his insides.

The sound of foot steps echo down the hall, and he turns to look.  Ji is rotund. She is also short.  Dominic nods at her and starts to make her a coffee.

"Why are you always naked?"  Her voice is gruff; her accent is slight but still audible to the trained ear.  She wears a yellow jumpsuit with a brown lightening bolt down one side, stretched out over her body.

"I have shorts on." Dominic shrugs as he hands her the coffee.

"Those are barely shorts; I can see your penis." Her words sharp, each syllable pinched off with accusation.  Smoothing into a softer tone, almost pleasant. "Not that I'm complaining."

A slight shake of his head. "Ji…"

"Yeah, I know. You and your boys.  Where is the dainty one?"

A smile creeps across Dominic's face, "Max hates when you call him that.  He's still sleeping.  We are the only morning people in this lovely place."

"Fuck that, I'm not a morning person. I like to see your penis, and you make good coffee."  A hearty laughter erupts from her taking on the form of a deep guttural cough before petering out.

# Levi

Levi Kane, previously a one star general in the now defunct New Cascadia Army sleeps in a make shift shelter cobbled together out of the left over parts of a sun-bleached Impala, the aging interior crusty with wind blown sand, a fine powder of abrasion having worn the leather into a dull shine. The vibration of his silent alarm stirs him awake, and with deft movements, he is standing, sunglasses slamming onto his face.  The extraction is set for 6am, and 5:45am blinks languidly out from the lenses in a crisp red readout.

He pulls up the dossier for his extract target, reading over the details of a midlevel human interaction engineer from a no name division in what used to be Utah.  "This woman isn't even worth the cost of this extraction," he mutters to the emptiness of the desert.

The rumble of a motorcade echoes out across valley, bouncing off of the mesas surrounding the valley.  *Showtime*.  He quickly reviews the parameters of the mission. *one handler, two guards, three cars, all self-driven*.  He smirks. *too easy*.  He pulls out a small cylindrical device with a comically sized red button on it. He has a flair for the dramatic, and loves the aesthetics of movies from before the turn of the century.  Etched into the turned aluminum body of the device are the letters E, M, and P in a humanist san-serif font, bold, but not too overpowering.

He waits, in the cover of his shelter.  The sound dopplers in as the motorcade gets closer.  The detonation device is buried under the road right where they are charted to turn.  The recon data suggests that she is in the middle car, so the plan is to detonate the device when the first car passes. *come on, you lazy sonofabitch, faster* he clenches his jaw, shaking his leg for extra emphasis. *Just a little more*.

The first car passes over the spot, slowing to make the turn down the side road.  He presses in the plunger, and a shockwave of compressed sound rushes across the valley, and all three cars stop in their tracks.  In five quick strides, he is across the road, gun drawn.  Bang.  Light, silent steps, up and over the middle car. Bang. Bang. Rebound onto the middle car's roof. Crash, the windows cave in. Bang.  A woman screams, echoing repeatedly off the sandstone walls that box them in.  "You work for Nakitashi now."

# Max

The smooth silken sheet hangs lightly over Max's long, lithe body. Sunlight bathes the room, reflecting off the white tile, making it impossible for Max to escape it.  It is the time of the morning where the bedroom is stifling hot. The covers cascade to the ground as Max reflectively kicks them off, exposing his body to the sunlight. The sun skips across his naked body.  He rubs his eyes, trying to rouse his senses.  

"Alexis, what time is it?" he calls out.

A small purple ring embedded in the wall begins to pulse, an older model digital assistant is part of the apartment, a perk for Nakitashi corporate housing.  It's slow, but functional.  After a few seconds, the disembodied voice of Alexis responds, "The time is 10:33am. You will be late for work, Max".

Muscles twitch, a quick response, a part of his ritual, perpetually late for work.  Grabbing a towel, he runs out into the common hallway, streaking towards the showers. 

At this time of the day, most people are already at work, so the showers are empty.  Max quickly covers himself in the industrial, multipurpose gel that Nakitashi provides as the most efficient, lowest environmentally impactful cleaning product possible.  The shower fills with a mixture of sulfur and lavender.  This stuff always gives Max a headache for at least an hour.  Another rough morning for the rising star of the biomech division of Nakitashi Corp.

Two minutes are entering the shower, he's toweling himself off as he shuffles his way back to his apartment.  Stepping through the door, Alexis chimes in, "You have received a message from Akio, shall I read it to you?"

Wincing at the name, "yes."  The purple ring pulses languidly as the processor generates the words for Alexis to speak.

"Presentation this morning?  11am, you get here, now"

"Oh fuck!"  Max grabs a pink tee-shirt, a grinning cat sketched across half of it, slipping it over his head.  He pulls on his favorite pair of embedded shorts, a slim black pair with sensors that monitor air quality and muscle activation.  He rushes out the door forgetting to put on his shoes.

He touches the implant on his right wrist lighting up the time under his skin.  The glowing numbers read "10:45am".  15 minutes. He can do this.  Through slight movements of his fingers, he scrolls through menu items to find "car".  A couple more movements and a company car is waiting for him as he exits the corporate housing building.  He gets in the car, and it speeds off to Nakitashi Plaza.

…

11:01am stares at him through the glass of the meeting room walls. His hurried steps continue, throwing open the door, and huffing for air.  All eyes are on him.  Akio stands at the front of the room.  "Ah, just in time.  What do you have for us, Maximilian?"

Sweat drips down into Max's eyes, his finger trembling as he keys his access code into the conference room table.  A holoprojector turns on from above the table.  A deep breath slowly trails out of his mouth, a shuttering release of air.  "Perfect worker loyalty" he begins.

# Ji
Ji stands out on the balcony of the 54th floor of the Nakitashi Plaza building.  A nicostick dangles from her lips, her left hand pressed the wall, steading herself.  Her eyes are unfocused, a direct audio feed from Akio's meeting room sends pulses directly to her cochlear nerve, presenting a sound that is more real than real life, and cannot be eavesdropped on, except by electrical means.  If one inspected the device close enough, with an electron microscope, they would see "NewTek International Holdings" emblazoned on it.

A long drag on the nicostick, and Ji's hands steady, her breathing lengthens.  She leans back against the wall, looking out onto Nakitashi City, the capitol of Nakitashi Corporate Land Holdings, LTD, the liability shelter setup after Akio Nakitashi purchased the failed New Cascadia, one of the last bastions of democracy, the last hold out against the UCSA and their power. 

Nakitashi City is not very big, but the natural formation of hills separate the city into distinct zones.   The crumbling ruins of the old city stretch between Lake Akio and the Wide Fjord of Advancement, a large stretch of water being fed by the Pacific Ocean.

The original denizens of the old city could not agree on the style of the city. The ruins are a hodgepodge of baroque facades with the amorphous shapes of the early 21st centuries concepts of modern, monstrosities of aluminum, glass, and unmatched colors.

Ji's eyes fixate on the one penis shaped structure, a spindled spire, that abruptly ends in fractured edges, giving hint of incompleteness.  As a kid, she learned that it was once called a needle, but all she sees is a broken penis.

# Dominic
Dominic pounces on Max as soon as the door slides open, arms around Max's waist, tight, pulling.  "I heard that your project was greenlit!"  He kisses Max, a deep passionate kiss.  Max drops the bag he was holding.

Max pulls back, disengaging, breathing a deep solid breath. "How did you hear?  It's supposed to be top secret."  His eyes narrow, gazing with intensity.

"Oh, I overheard someone saying that you were a lucky sonofabitch, saying you probably fucked Mr Nashitaki to get the green light.  The normal office bullshit."

"Jealous, bitter hags."

"Let's celebrate!" He pulls Max into him harder, pulling him over to the bed.  They fall backwards, the sofa foam of the bed catching their weight with effortless ease.

"Oh? Is this what you want?" Max says has he unbuttons Dominic's pants.

…

Two naked bodies intertwined, sweat glistens off of their chests as deep breathing begins to slow, a lurid mixture of sweat and sex permeates the air.  With a heavy sigh, Dominic pulls himself free, become separate entities again.  He stands up, and walks to the bathroom, Max reaches out in vain to stop him. "Come back here."

"I'm going shower, need to wash all of this off of me" he jesters to his chest and neck.

Max sits up in bed, crossing his arms and pouting as Dominic continues to the bathroom.  He flicks the shower to hot, then cold, trying to find the perfect temperature.  The water rushes over him, warming his body against the cold morning air.  Lather, rise, repeat, his hands glide over his body, covering every crevice, scouring away the remnants of their passion.

He becomes lost in himself as the water ebbs and flows over his back, ears filling and emptying as water winds its way down his body.  

"Hey, there is a new club opening up, pansexual, each floor has a different theme.  Let's go tonight?"  Max calls from outside the bathroom door, the sound muffled by the water in Dominic's ears.

"Sure, sounds fun." Dominic shuts off the water valve, and steps out of the shower, water dripping and pooling on the floor.  He palms the door open, Max's eyes travel the length of his body, lingering on his crotch.

"Up for round two?"

…

The exterior of Club Elysium has a mirror finish and no exterior lighting except the sign.  An orgy of colors swirl and dance above the building and over the street surrounding Elysium.  The reflections bath Dominic and Max is a multitude of hues.  The door is imperceptible, a thin etched line in the otherwise continuous mirrored facade.  As they approach the door, the light from the sign coalesces into concentrated beams  of magenta, either pupils scanned.

Club Elysium is another part of the wide, suffocating embrace of the Nakitashi Corporation.  Their employee IDs are whisked away, through optical fibers to the central data processing hub.  A log entry in their personal file is created, timestamped, with accompanying pictures, taken from a hidden camera behind the mirrors of the club.

The door slides open, and the bass washes over them, an aural tidal wave, assaulting their vestibular system, inducing a euphoric, light-headed feeling.  The walk on into a panoramic view of the inside of the club.  It's an open air atrium with a five story ramp circumscribing the perimeter of the atrium.

The DJ station floats on tensioned aircraft steel in the center of the atrium, and a pair of robots sit at turntables, mixing the music using algorithms that moderate the energy levels of the crowd, remotely monitoring their biosigns, adjusting and manipulating to keep the crowd engage and amused.

"Want to get a drink?" Max screams into Dominic's ear, trying to overcome the music.  They walk over to a drink console.  Dominic selects gin and tonic, and Max selects scotch, neat.  Their drinks are dispensed by unseen pumps and mechanical arms.  They appear on the outstretched tray moments later.

Performers dangle everywhere around the DJ station, contorting and manipulating their bodies around pieces of steel, rope, and fabric. Their naked bodies dripping sweat into the crowd as they fling themselves around, upside down, and drop.

Dominic leans over to Max, mouth to his ear, pointing at one of the performers, "I bet he gets wicked rope burns on his ass."  They both laugh.

"But he has a pretty fantastic ass."  Dominic nods his head.  "I wonder what time he is done performing?"

"Why?"  heads swinging back and forth so they can hear each other.

"He'd be fun in bed.  Look how bendy he is."

"What?"

"I said, he'd be fun in bed!"

"Oh."  Dominic looks down at the ground, shifting his weight from one foot to the other, taking a sip of his drink.  A brief respite in the intensity of the music, slowing, softening, but the pianissimo is but a brief moment in time before the full brunt of the bass line pounds into them.

# Vienne

NewTek International Holdings is an umbrella corporation primarily responsible for stealing most of the technological advancements in the last 50 years.  Vienne is a handler for NewTek International Holdings. Her primary responsibility is being the contact person for a small group of spies that NewTek International Holdings employs.  These spies are in deep cover, sometimes years at a time, infiltrating neighboring corporate states, and relaying information back to NewTek so they can beat people to market with new technologies.

Vienne is pacing in her office on the top floor of the KK building, NewTek's espionage wing. They call themselves the Advanced Research Division, but that is just a euphemism. It is common knowledge, but NewTek is too powerful for any other corporate state to try to stop them.

Vienne is pacing because she has not heard from her best agent. He's been undercover for 5 years now.  She bites on her fingernail, cracking it, cursing under her breath.  A large operational monitor covers the entire wall opposite her desk.  Her eyes dart between the monitor and her desk's holographic display.

She leans over and types another message into the console.

"Nic, questioned allegiance. Need to meet. NT Bar, midnight. Pls Rspd"

"That little fucker better not be turning on me."

Simon is standing in the doorway unnoticed.  He clears his throat, and Vienne's eyes lock onto him.  "What?" she snaps.

"The leaders are getting concerned, Madame." His English is rough, unpolished, thick with an uncomfortable accent.  "They are concerned with his length."

"Nic is our best agent.  I'm going to be reasserting his allegiance tonight.  Tell them I have it under control."

"Madame, they fear he is turning."

"He isn't turning.  He's a professional."

"Five years, lies can start becoming real, Madame."

"Not with Nic."

"How can you be sure?"

"He's our best agent."

"Yes, Madame."  Simon touches his ear and stares at the ground for a second.  "They are requesting a full diagnostics report after tonight's rendezvous."

# Dominic

The lab is built in the same way as the corporate housing.  White polymer tiles are a consistent feature everywhere, and for Dominic, they are suffocating today.  He rereads the message, sighing heavily as it flashes across his eyes. The eye implant is undetectable, an advancement that is still a few years away from being available to the general public.

His fingers twiddle across his left wrist, typing out: "Can't, Max will suspect. Mrng Run, 5am, NCP?"

"Fine." flashes.

Dominic returns back to the device sitting on his workbench, rescrewing the access cover, and flipping the switch on. A small puff of smoke rises quickly from the device, and he switches it off again.

…

5am: An electrical signal from his implant stimulates his pituitary gland, beginning a slow increase of cortisol into his blood stream.  The bedroom is dark, but the cortisol speeds up his heart rate, increasing blood flow over his entire system, and his eyes shoot open.  He slips quietly out of bed, puts on his running gear, and slowly closes the door behind him.

Nakitashi Central Park is at the exact middle of the Nakitashi corporate state.  It is the nexus point, the layout of the state funnels into Central Park from all directions.  Legend has it the state is laid out according to some ancient superstitions about placement and energy flow.  Dominic believes it.  Central Park is a magical place, a sanctuary where he can escape who he is, what he is doing, and how he's betraying Max.

Vienne is a tall woman with jet black hair.  He has never seen her wear anything with color, and today is no different.  She leans against a decorative arch, sucking in on a nicostick, the vapor slowly trailing out of her nose.  The light of the predawn just starting to flood in, she is a monochrome vision of the likes of a John Huston film.

She approaches him, and embraces him tightly, kissing him lightly on both cheeks.  "My dear," she whispers into his ear.

"My allegiance is in question?" He gently creates space between them, a small gesture that does not go unnoticed.

"Yes.  The leaders are concerned."

"And?"

"They want a full diagnostics report."

"I'm not some robot."

"Aren't you?"

"Fuck you, Vienne.  You are the one who ended it, not me."

"And now I'm assigned as your handler.  This isn't about us."

"You are right, it's not."

"Are you going to allow me to get the diagnostics report willingly?"

"Yes." He holds out his left wrist, and she takes it. Her fingers travel lightly across his skin.  *Damn her* a tingle travels down his spine.

She removes a small device from her pocket.  It's a nondescript black box with two wires dangling from it.  She places the wires on each side of his wrist, and swipes the cover of the box.  "Remember, this will hurt a little." She presses the red X that has appeared on the box, and all of Dominic's muscles tense, eyes clenching against the pain.

His mind shuts down, devoid of all thought, a cycle of colors swirling through his imagination. The colors take on forms and play out scenes from the last five years.  The initial mission briefing. The forced introduction to Max. Their first kiss. Their first date. Being hired at Nakitashi. The entire five years plays out in staccato.

To this very moment, and his body relaxes collapsing to the ground.  Vienne makes no attempt to catch him as he crumples to the ground.  She pulls her foot out from under his head.  Dominic's eyes snap open as she removes the electrodes from his wrist.

"That seemed a bit more painful than usual" a dispassionate calm mingles in with a sense of disgust.

Dominic stands up, his hands, weak from the session, brush the dirt sticking to his clothes.  "Are you sure you had that configured correctly?  It was the full five years."

"That's what they wanted."  She bites her fingernail as she stares at Nakitashi Plaza. "Did it hurt?"

Dominic kneads the back of his neck, working out the tension that is building there.  "It's going to hurt tomorrow."

"You better run along."  She touches her ear for a brief moment. "They say they want the plans for Project Unicorn, and that once stolen, they should be destroyed."

"Project Unicorn is Max's project."

"They know, their other intel sources within Nakitashi said that it is something we would be interested in keeping out of the hands of any other corporation. Too much potential.  You have your orders.  When it's complete, steal it, destroy all copies within Nakitashi, and return the plans to us."

"And then what? Max will be devastated."

"Then your mission will be complete and you can leave him."

Dominic's eyes drift to the ground, and he blinks back tears, hoping Vienne does not see, does not interpret.

"Nic, Is your mission compromised by attachment to your mark?"

Head down, he looks up at Vienne, locking eyes. "En, my mission is not compromised by attachment."

"Good, I'd hate to tell you what it meant we'd have to do next."

"Are we done here?"  She nods, and he jogs away.

# Max

Max believes he is psychic. It is a stupid belief, but his mother swears it runs in the family. His grandmother and great grandmother also believed. They say it usually is handed down to the women in the family, but once in a great while, a man gets it.  The men in the family usually are not as powerful as the women, but nevertheless, the men get feels, and right now, Max has a feeling.

The apartment is deathly quiet with Max sitting up in bed, goosebumps growing down his arms, spreading across his chest, and down his back.  It is the feeling of something bad coming.  It is 6am, and Dominic is not here which worries Max.  Dominic's routine is different today; Max instinctively feels it is wrong.

A knock on the door breaks the silence; three sharp raps echo off the smooth polished tiles.  Max jumps slightly with each knock, in a stupor, a dangerous mix of not being a morning person and having too much on his mind.  He pops out of bed, walking to the door, signaling it to open.  Ji, the loud mouth Chinese girl who works in Structural, stands with her hands on her hips.  The same yellow jumpsuit she always wears in the morning strains against her body.

"Oh, now I see why Dominic likes you."

"What?"

"Your penis."  Max looks down, so preoccupied he forgot to put clothes on, he does his best to cover himself with his hands, and retreats into the bathroom, throwing on a pair of shorts.

Ji has come into the apartment and is surveying the surroundings.  The room is mostly clean, a small nightstand with a digital book sits to one side of the ample bed.  Like all Nakitashi employee apartments, everything is glaring white; color is an extravagance that Nakitashi believes serves no purpose.

"What do you want, Ji?  It's quite early."

"I know, Dominic usually makes me coffee, but he wasn't here this morning.  Where is he?"

"I don't know" his brow furrows, and he massages his right deltoid for a moment before he notices and stops.

"Fuck, I don't know how to make coffee."

"Sorry."

"Whatever, dainty,"  and she leaves, the door slides closed behind her.

Max glares at the closed door and grumbles.

# Ji

Ji's apartment is covered in color. A vibrant mural of colors melding and mutating sprawl across the walls, ceiling, and floor.  As she enters, the lights start to flicker and fade.  The hacked digital assistant, overclocked, draws power from the lighting system to improve its abilities.

"Fucker, lock down protocol 12."

"Yes mistress" the digital assistant in subservient, but sultry male voice.  The cachunk of a heavy gauge lock slots into place, and the lights dim further.  "Full signal encryption enabled, opening channel to handler."

A viewscreen appears from behind the one tile that is not covered in paint.  Vienne's face slowly fades onto the screen as it adjusts the brightness to the room.  A scowl, almost ever present when Ji is talking to her, appears on her face.

"What do you want, Ji?  This is highly unusual."

"My mark is outside of his usual routine."

"Not something to be concerned with, and not something that required my immediate attention."

"Sorry, but what should I do?"

"Agent, you are capable of acting autonomously without our direct guidance.  What do you feel you should do?"

"I don't know."

Vienne types a few things on her console, out of sight, but audible.  "Our intel shows that he went on a morning run."

"But why?"

"That's for you to find out.  Ji, are you doing okay?  This is your first mission, so it's understandable that you might not have all the answers, we understand."

"I'm fine. The mission is fine. it's great."

"Ji, we have complete faith in your abilities. When things deviate, just file a report, preferably using form sixty-eight stroke A one."

"Sure."

"Good.  Bye."  The viewscreen fades to cerulean blue.  "Fucker, hallway view," and the screen bursts back into life, showing a view of the hallway just in time to see Dominic walk into the hallway, exhausted steps lingering, trailing down the hallway.  It takes him forever to reach his door.

She continues to watch.  It is only moments before he is back out the door, towel wrapped around him, as he shuffles down the hall in shower shoes.  "Fucker, reset".  The room lights return back to normal, and the lock cachunks back open.  Her hurried steps carry her to the door and through it, bumping directly into Dominic.

"Oh, crap, I'm sorry." she mutters, avoiding his eyes.

"Ji, sorry I didn't make the coffee. I went for a run. I was coming to tell you I'll make you some after I shower."

"Oh, it's okay."

"Max said you came by looking for me."

"Yeah…"

"I'll shower quickly."

"Okay."

He turns around and continues down the hallway to shower.  Blood rushes to her face, causing crimson waves of heat to flush over her.  She watches has the muscles of his back undulate as he walks toward the showers.  The tattoo of a serpent curled around a sword seems alive as his shoulder blades crest and fall with his arms swinging.

# Vienne

Ji's face fades off of the holographic display.  Vienne sits back in her chair, body heavy and sinking into the supple nano-impregnated faux leather cushions which respond to the shift in pressure with agile little fingers, adjusting to support, cradle, and caress.

A slender woman is sitting military straight in the chair across the desk.  The morning sun drenches her golden curls turning them into a blazing cascade of honey.  She wears a name tag which reads "Alexandrine Brant, Governess of the United Corporate States of America."

"Sorry for the interruption.  Ji is one of our newest agents working in the field.  She has great potential, but doubts herself too much."

"It is quite all right. It's important to make time for your employees, and to make them feel they are valuable members of your team."  Her voice thick with Bavarian influences.

"Indeed.  Now where were we?"

"You were just about to brief me on this Project Unicorn nonsense."

"Ah yes. Project Unicorn. From our initial intel, it is a reprogramming and mind control technology that was previous thought to be impossible."

"Reprogramming?"

"Yes, if our intel is correct, Nakitashi is expecting to use it to induce complete company loyalty, squashing the worker rebellions once and for all.  This is troubling technology.  They could raise an army and would be in complete control of every unit.  This would undermine everything the UCSA has been working towards for the last ten years."

Alexandrine shifts her weight in the chair, face scrunching, shifts a second time, and then stands, walking towards the window, eyes fixed on the horizon.

"And you have agents on all the key players for this project?"

"Fortune has favored us.  The principal researcher  on Project Unicorn was someone we had earmarked for forceful defection at some point in the future.  One of our best agents is currently infiltrated as his lover for the past four years."

Alexandrine nods slowly, fingers tapping on the window, eye blank and glazing over as she considers this new information.  "And you've ordered the device plans retrieved and destroyed?"

"Retrieve a copy, destroy the original, bring the copy here."

"And what of the researcher?"

Vienne takes a deep breath. "We hope he'll be too devastated from the betrayal that he will never try to make the device again."

Alexandrine turns sharply around.  "Not good enough.  Kill or Capture.  These are, of course, strictly off the record recommendations.  As Governess, I cannot interfere with the operations of any of the corporations that are part of the union."

Vienne lowers her eyes. "I do not think my agent will be capable of killing in this case; I'll get an extraction team to remove the researcher."

She nods.  Her blond curls bounce playfully around her face. "Great.  Until next time." She snaps around to face the door. "Let's get this sorted by next week." And she walks out the door.

"Fuck." Vienne's voice barely audible over the sound of the door sliding shut.

# Dominic

Dominic enters yet another lab in the biotech wing of Nakitashi, it looks like every other lab, but he knows this one better than even his own.  "Maximilian Bosko, Senior Neurotechnologist, Impulse Control" is lit up on the side of the door, glowing in a pale blue light that etch around the letters.  Max is not there, so Dominic punches in the access codes, and the door slides quietly open.  He places a small silver wedge on the floor, a new proximity sensor that he designed last week.

Dominic slips through, palming the door closed behind him, a low gloom engulfs the room as the unfiltered light from outside slides out of view.  With hurried steps, the walks over the terminal, gloves appearing from his pocket and sliding onto his hands.  The terminal comes alive as he places his hands near the keyboard. A login prompt stares back at him.

A litany of common passwords blink across the screen, each one shaking an incorrect indicator at him.  A brief moment passes, and then he keys in 20541026 and presses enter.  A giant smiley face appears on the screen, and then fades away to reveal Max's workspace. *The day we met* He chews on the inside of his lower lip while opening up Max's notebook.

The entry for today:

*Project Unicorn is my greatest success and my greatest failure. While developing it, I wasn't thinking about the real ramifications of what this meant. It was supposed to help keep people happy, help them understand they role they are playing within the organization, but I fear I've stepped over the line.*

*I didn't think that they would use it to reprogram people's personality. The device is entirely too effective as swaying the test subjects, so much so that we've been able to convince them they are someone else entirely.*

*Luckily, I stopped one experiment.  Jerome went a little too far with one of the test subjects.  Had I not stepped in, they might have ended up married.  Jerome is a little desperate at the moment, but that doesn't excuse his behavior.  I've asked to have him transferred off of the project.*

*I do not know what I'm going to do.  My conscious is eating at me, and I can't talk to Dominic about it because of the security clearance for this project.  I wish they would just assign him to the project, so I wouldn't have to keep all of this from him.*

He stops reading.  A vibration in his arm means that someone has tripped the proximity sensor.  He quickly locks the terminal, removes his gloves, and sits down, thumbing his holoprojector on, his news feed flashes into view as the door slides open.

"Ji?"  Her silhouette partially blocks the light streaming in from the hallway.

"Dominic? What are you doing here?"

"I was going to ask you the same thing!"

"Max asked me to stop into the lab.  He thinks he forgot his backpack."

"And he gave you his access code for that?"

"Yeah? He gave me the temporary guest one for the day."  Dominic narrows his eyes, her face still full of shadows, a stark contrast from the bright light of the hallway.   "What are you doing here?"

"Oh. Um. I."  Dominic rubs the back of his neck. "I was going to surprise him with a midday… you know."  He brings his hand up to his mouth in an obscene gesture.  "We haven't really had much… alone… time lately."  He shrugs. "Need to fit it in where we can."

Ji's face flushes with blood, shifting from one foot to another as she walks into the lab and palms the door closed.  "Right here in the lab?  Man, that's hot."  Dominic chuckles deep from within his belly.

"Except he's not here."

# Ji
The door slides closed behind Dominic, and Ji is left in the darkness of the lab.  Her eyes search the corners of the room as she sighs, and plops down onto the green sofa, a color reminiscent of the pale green of baby food that's been left out too long.  On the white board behind it, in hurried, sprawling script "Thinking chair" with a swoop of an arrow pointing at the chair.

A long, slow exhale trails out of her mouth as she shifts her weight, continuing to look around. *Fuck this is going to be boring waiting for him*  Her eyes dart left, and dart right, head lagging behind by a brief moment.  She leans forward, leans back, shifts her weight again.

"Fuck this." she says aloud, and stands up, leaving the lab.  Down the hall, she strides, the stomp heavy feet rebounding off the walls. She pulls her wrist up to her face, and dances her fingers across the surface. *Now I'll get a notice every time Max swipes his access badge or uses his access codes*

She slips off into a side corridor, approaching a door that is marked "Janitor".  She puts her eye up to the door, even with a smudge on the otherwise clean white door.  Light illuminates her eye, a bright magenta line burst across her eye, and a quiet chime, soft and random like a wind chime precedes the door sliding open on air tracks, smooth, efficient, silent.

She slips in, and the door slides closed behind her, the shift of the air pressure the only noticeable marker.  The security office is expansive.  Endless rows of monitors line either side of the room, the vanishing point fades into darkness at the far end of the room.  The room is mostly empty.  A few terminals on the far end are manned, security interns, all young, hunch over the terminals, typing furiously, the clack of their keyboards create a soft cacophony in the room.  Claire sits at the first terminal inside of the room on the left side.  Her feet swing in counter balance with each other, and she is watching one of the feeds from the dorms.  Her loose curls of red hair bounce as her legs swing.  She notices Ji enter, and smiles.

"Hi, Ji!"

"Hello, Claire.  Whatcha watching?" She pulls up a chair and sits down next to Claire.

"Dorm feed, it's pretty boring.  Saw you getting your morning coffee."

"Did you see Dominic and his inability to wear clothes?"

"I saw the blurry smudge that the software always renders for him not wearing clothes in the halls."

"Such a shame."

"Not really.  Women are better. In. Every. Way." She arches an eyebrow, giving a crooked smile.  A hearty chuckle erupts from Ji.

"And don't you forget it."  Across all of the terminals in the security room, an alert pops up, accompanied by a slight vibration in Ji's wrist.  The alert reads "Maximilian Bosko has scanned his ID badge in Elevator #1-A-1."

"Huh, I guess I made it a security broadcast, not just to my comm unit.  Can you clean that up for me Claire?  I need to run and catch Max before he gets sucked into his research again.

Claire nods as Ji runs out the door.

# Levi

The whir of an ancient printer spins to life, spitting out sheets of dead trees with a black powder melted onto it using lasers.  The powder spells out words.  Levi likes ancient technology, the unconnected, bastions of the old world, the old nation, from the time before when the illusion of for the people by the people still existed. This ever present connected life is a vile thing to him.

Levi and his printer are housed in a small cabin in a no-man's land between his once beloved New Cascadia and the desert that stretches to the East.  The rough-hewn planks that line the walls bare the marks of a hand axe, sloppily applied, the random cuts show the frustration over time, a beautiful testament to why no one builds their own homes anymore.  The room is sparsely furnished, a small military cot sits in one corner and there is an old door sitting on top of some legs salvaged from a diner as a makeshift desk on which the printer sits along with a slender silver rectangle, hinged and open displaying a black screen with a single hash sign in white at the bottom.

The paper is gliding out of the printer, cascading gracefully to the floor.  He snatches the last page out of the air.  *Another work order* He scans the page for the most important piece of information.  "$5b UCSA credits" is printed at the bottom of the page in large, heavy type.  Knees bending with heavy, echoing cracks, he bends to shuffle the rest of the pages off of the floor.

He nods slowly.  *Some bio-nerd at Nakitashi, capture or kill, double money for capture than kill.*  He reads over the intel about position, current habits. *This guy doesn't go anywhere other than work and the dorms.*  "Hmmmm" breaks the silence.  "Elysium."

# Dominic

Elysium is in full swing when Dominic arrives, quickly slipping through the security, he is a seasoned pro now, the dance, the ritual plays out silently, magenta caressing his retinas.

Max is there, standing at the bar, hand gently around the bronzed hip of the aerialist, standing dangerously close together, naked flesh pressed against Max's clothes.  Dominic swallows hard, hand trembling, and begins to walk in their direction.  His eyes locked on Max.  *Why am I bothered by this?  Max is just a mark.*  His heart pounds louder than the music, his breathing ragged.

Max's eyes train onto Dominic, his hand retracts, and blood rushes to his face.  

"Nic? What are you doing here?"

"Me?"

"Felix was just explaining his training regime.  He said anyone can learn how, and he'd be willing to teach me."

"Yes" his voice thick with a Barcelonian accent, "it's quite easy, once you have the strength."  Pointing his long manicured fingers at Dominic, "You look like you have the strength already."

Dominic cocks an eyebrow, tilting his head.  Felix is covered in microlights pulsing to the beat of the music.  Dominic is having trouble looking at him.  "I would think endurance would be required more than strength?"

"I do have plenty of endurance too" Felix inches closer to Dominic, closing the triangle. "I usually go all night."

Dominic narrows his eyes and looks over at Max and then returns to Felix and a smile spreads across his face.

An older man, built like a tank, pushes his way passed Max, knocking him into Felix, who catches him with deft hands.  All eyes are on the man, muscles tight, bulging out of his shirt. He smell coming off of the him wrinkles all of their noses.  "Out of my way, I need a drink," he barks at them.

All three retreat, Max rubbing his arm, a little dab of blood smears onto his fingers. "The fucker cut me or something."

"How about we go back to your place and get that cleaned up?"  Felix takes their hands, and leads them out of the club.

# Max

Max keys in the code to his lab.  His disheveled hair wiggles at the air pressure difference as the lab door swings open.  His steps are slow and shuffling, his head hangs low.  Last night was wild, but this morning is rough.  His head pounds.  Not looking up, he palms the door closed. "Lights, 25% please" his voice ragged with exhaustion.

He jumps at the sound, "Hi Max."  Looking up, his eyes lock on Ji's short cropped hair, and then her eyes. 

"Hi Ji, what are you doing here?"

"I heard some rumors about your newest project."

"Clearance, Ji, I can't talk about it.  How did you get in here?"

She walks over to a terminal and types in a couple of commands on the terminal.  Her clearance record comes up on the screen.  "I have higher clearance than you.  I'm part of Nakitashi Corps security force, and you are in danger."

"What?  How is that possible?"

"I've been working on infiltrating NewTek's espionage division for quite some time.  They have me spying on Nic.  I'm not even sure why, nothing he is working on is worth stealing."

"Nic is under surveillance from NewTek?"

"Yes, and I caught him sneaking in here.  I don't know what he was planning, but something is happening, and I'm not sure what."

"How am I in danger?"

"NewTek is going to extract you.  They say Project Unicorn is too powerful.  I'm supposed to distract Nic so he remains unharmed and unaware."

Max collapses onto the floor, tears filling his eyes.  "I wish I had never had this fucking idea," he wails.  Ji meanders over to him, her motions tentative, searching.  She places her hand on his shoulder, squatting down to his level.  She raps him quickly across the face.

"Pull your shit together, we need to get you into protective custody.  Now!" she manhandles him, pulling him to his feet, her strength belying her size.  A gun has appeared from the aether, and she is pushing him out the door.

Max snaps out of his fugue state, wrenching his arm out of her grasp.

"No!" a force of will he is not used to mustering.  "Where is Nic?  We can't let him get caught in the cross fire."

"Goddamn it, we don't have time for this shit."  Everything goes black as the crackle of a stunpatch echoes down the hallway.

# Vienne

Vienne paces her office.  The holoprojector of Ji's bust hovers above the center table. The painting of an abstract scene of a worker rebellion seeps through the imperfect project, colors infusing Ji's figure with certain gayety, a juxtaposition not lost on Vienne.

"What do you mean Maximilian has disappeared?"

"That's what Dominic told me, he's quite worried. I don't think he's even showered in a few days."

"One moment."  She quickly disengages the holoprojector, and picks up a small receiver from her desk, pressing in the sequence "53409871049103###".  A squelching sound reverberates around her office, then static, then a voice.

"Operator Seven" a deep male voice intones.

"Seven Eight Nine, Tango, Xylophone, Alpha."

"Target has not been acquired.  Recon still happening."

She puts the device down, clicking the power button off, then reengages the holoprojector.

"… I can't, I can't get no, I can't get no …" Off-key and arrhythmically.

"Ji!"  And her holographic form starts, coming to attention. "Our extraction agent has not taken him.  You must find out what happened.  Report back once you know more."  The holographic display clicks off with a press of a button.

"Shit. Shit. Shit."  Her fingers glide over the console, and after a few seconds, Dominic's face appears on the projector.  "Status report time, Nic."

"I thought the extract wasn't scheduled for a few days.  I didn't have time to get the research, and now that Max is gone, I don't know what i'm supposed to do about the research."  His eyes are bloodshot, his hair a scattered mess of red and black strands.

"Calm down, Dominic.  We have not taken him."

"What?" his eyes go wild. "Where is he then? Who took him? Is there another agency that knew about the project and beat us to the jump?"

"Highly unlikely.  Dominic, this project was handed down to us."  A brief pause as her fingers fly across the console keyboard.  The holograph blips out and then back in.

A disembodied voice, British, Female, the artificial intelligence's idea of a trust worth, learned voice, "Encryption Protocol Engaged. All further communication is deemed top secret, priority one.  Do not disclose under penalty of death."

"This mission is coming from the Governess of the UCSA directly. No other agency is privy, unless she has lost faith in our ability to deliver, but she would have notified me."

"What if it's unsanctioned?"

"Impossible.  No corporation would be that suicidal." doubt begins to creep into her brain, but she brushes it away.

"What about–"

"–Those are folklore, Dominic.  We, " emphasis, " are the black ops."

"Right…"

"Dominic, just relax. I have at least one agent on this. Your current action items are to remain calm, downplay his disappearance, convince people that he is just on a vacation.  Dead aunt, maybe?"

Dominic rubs his eyes with the heel of his hands, running his hands through his hair.  "Okay.  I'll try."

"There is an ancient proverb, 'Do or do not, there is no try.' Just remember that."

He nods his head, and the screen blips off.

# Levi

There are times when Levi will admit new technology is worth a damn. This is one of those times.  A small red dot hovers above a paper map laid out on the large wooden table in his embassy suite, much too posh for the likes of him, paid for by NewTek International Holdings.  High power clients come with perks.

His muddy boots are propped up on the artisan surface of the table, smearing what smells like shit onto the edge of the table.  He remains placid, intently watching the dot.  It is moving rapidly. *must be in a car, where is he going?*

The red dot is a projection from the holoprojector.  A geotrack™ receiver is communication with airborne drones that hover the city, relaying signals in a mesh.  The drones are part of a Nakitashi-led research project to develop self-healing packet relay networks that are unbound by the earth.  They indiscriminately transfer packets between them, routing seamlessly from source to destination through a trillion microdecisions.  The employees call it "the brain of Nakitashi-san".  There is more than a little hint of ridicule in the name, but it serves its purpose.

And in Levi's case, it's routing the positioning signal from the geotrack™ embedded device he injected into his extraction target.  He is glad that he suffered through Elysian to get this device into his target.  The target had gone dark for a full day, did not return home, did not go to work, did not visit his fuck-buddy in Elysian.  No trace by conventional means.

The holoprojector pops up a small floating box with "Incoming…" written in it.  "Encryption enabled, please state response to challenge A5DE02F" appears, letter by letter.

Slow and methodical fingers tap in the response code "æbleskiver kiesershmarrn crêpe pancake".  It takes him three minutes to type it in.  Vienne appears on the screen.

"About fucking time, old man."

"How can I help you, Ms. Baune?"

"What's the status of the extraction?"

"The target went dark yesterday.  I have activated the tracking device I implanted in him.  Tracking his movement now, and he appears to be in a car."

"I have reason to believe that Nakitashi is aware of the eminent extraction."

"My price triples."

"What?"  the word cuts through the air like a garrote.

"Hazard pay. It's in the contract.  Extract requires breaching security even further than originally planned.  Target has settled, according to the city blueprints, he is being held at Nakitashi Maximum Security Prison."

"So get yourself arrested."

"Negative. Too high profile.  Get me as a guard. You have those connections, I'm just muscle."

"One moment, Mr. Kane."  A third voice on the line, unfamiliar, ambiguously a woman's voice, most likely some AI.  NewTek holds the patents on some pretty impressive AI right now.  A small box pops up, a series of skeuomorphic folders appear in the holoprojector.  "Your new identity.  Please use transfer protocol alpha to install into implant,"  the AI voice chimes.

"Extract will be done before the end of the day."

# Ji

*fuck fuck fuck* Two guards in crisp black uniforms, with short, cylindrical caps, and the Nakitashi Security Force logo, a stylized shield with a snake on it, in black ink, on their breast pockets.  Between them, they carry a gurney, Max sprawled out, arms dangling, legs slightly akimbo.

They carry him into an isolation cell, Ji following closely behind, watching the medical read out.  Max's pulse is weak but stable.  The guards assist in moving Max onto the isolation cell's closed-cell foam block that serves as a bed.  Max's weight sinks into the foam, supporting him effortlessly.

All three exit the cell and Ji presses her wrist to the control panel.  A small vibration sends a pleasant shockwave down her arm, and the door slides closed with a hiss, sealing in place.

The guards take up a position on either side of the room.  "No one is allowed to interact with his prisoner.  Understood?  His identity, crime, and term of incarceration are clearance level zero."

In unison, "Yes, sir!"  One of the guards looks at the other guard, "um, I mean, ma'am."

Ji shakes her head, and walks towards the exit.  She turns back in time to see the guard hit the other one lightly on the shoulder and whisper to themselves.

*fuck fuck fuck*  She enters the main security office of the prison.  The three guards who are sitting at monitors jump to their feet and salute.  She waves them to sit down.  "I'm not military."

"But you are corporate security, so you out rank us." A fresh-faced guard speaks up, the scraggly ends of platinum blond hair shoot out from under his cap.  He has a round baby face, with cheeks Ji wants to pinch. 

"What's your name?"

"Cadet Johnson, ma'am!"

"Everyone is sir here, cadet."

"Sorry, sir."

"How long have you been working here?"

"Two months, sir."

She exhales sharply. "Give it time."

# Dominic

He holds a monofilament wire in his hand.  An adjustable loop droops down to the floor, the weight barely registering on the wire as it flutters in the wind.  The roof of the dorm is 115 stories up, and the wind is fierce, but he has no choice.  Max is gone, and something must be done to find him.

He steps close to the edge, the wind to his back, urging him closer and closer to the ledge.  One false step, and he will plummet to his death.  His target, one of the pieces of the brain hovering ten feet away, suspended in the sky by a series of whirling blades.

He takes a second piece of monofilament from the ground.  It's been anchored to a pipe that extends from the rooftop.  He ties it around his waist, ensuring there is no slack in the line.  He steadies his feet, bending his knees.  *Ten feet, You can do this*  He tosses the loop into the air, the wind catching it, pulling it further out from the building, but the eddy currents from the propellers divert it off course and away from the drone.

He breaths in deeply and slowly lets it out.  He pulls in monofilament, readying himself again.  This toss is too high, the loop catching the wind and overshooting the drone.  It begins the fall, fifteen feet out, as it reaches the level of the drone, the wind shifts slightly, blowing the filament right into one of the propellers.  The drone is coming in fast, winding the filament onto the rotor.  Dominic ducks out of the way, but one of the propellers catch him in the arm, opening a small gash on his deltoid, pain searing him as the drone falls to the ground.

It thrashes on the ground for a few seconds before the onboard computer registers that it has crash, and shuts off power to the motors.  He quickly reaches down, and pulls the battery before the distress signal can engage.  *Now it will just register as a power failure*

He steps away from the ledge, heading towards the service hatch.

…

The drone is splayed out in pieces on the bed, Dominic hovering over it, a murderer carefully laying out pieces of his victim for purposes unknown.

Dominic pulls the drone service manual from the edge of the bed.  His brow furrows, as his finger traces a line across the page.  A pair of wire cutters in his hand.  He snips a red wire.

"Okay, I think this does it."  He picks up the largest circuit board, clips two alligator clips to it.  He walks over to the wall near the holoprojector.  One of the smooth panels has been removed, exposing the circuitry underneath.  He peers in.  "Ah," and he clips the alligator clips to unseen points in the wall.

The holoprojector blips on, a random, glitching pattern swelling into the room.  He rushes over to the console, his hands fly over the keyboard with grace and determination.  The mass of the projection amalgamates into discrete blips, a field of stars.  Each star is labeled with a frequency band, geodex location within the city, and the current rate of data flow.

A few more minutes, and lines begin to slide across between nodes, short lengths of line, packets within the network, the speed picks up and soon it's running at full speed, a blur of data running through the system.

Soon, the colors of the lines begin to shift.  A search protocol for any mention of Max's id runs through the system.  A green line floats up out of the mire of the traffic, thin and faint.  Dominic stares at it, types a few things on the keyboard, and the line expands into a breakdown of the packet.

```
[ stunpatch v1.5.2;
  bpm:63;
  bp: 110/62; # warning out of nominal rage
  temperature: 98;
  brain-activity: low; ]
```

"He has a stunpatch on him!"  With a knitted brow, he begins to work out the origin drone.  The projection zooms in to a single drone.  "He's in the prison?"

He rushes out of the door, sliding into the wall as he shifts direction, heading down the hallway.  A slight heaving of his chest as he reaches Ji's door.  He bangs on it, and waits.  *Right, she'll be at work still*

He sprints back down the hallway to the elevator and presses the button once.  And then again.  And then again. This pattern repeats until the elevator doors open, and he walks in.  On the way down, he punches in a request for a car.

The car is waiting when he exists the building, he squints against the harsh light of the sun, and slides into the car.  "To Nakitashi Maximum Security Prison."

The voice of the car is deep, reverberating, and final. "You are not authorized for that location."  He slides over the top of the seat into the front seat, and pulls the autodrive system out.  Grasping the wheel, he flicks the car into gear, and pushes the throttle forward.  The car lurches forward, picking up speed, pressing him hard into the seat.

Signals fly back and forth between the Nakitashi central processing and the car.  The anomaly of the autodrive system suddenly disconnecting raises a flag. The subsequent acceleration, relayed by sensors on the car, causes the AI to decide that the vehicle has been stolen.  The Nakitashi police force is dispatched with the location of the vehicle, and the remote kill switch authorization code is transmitted over the drone network to the car.

The car slams to a stop, Dominic's head bashing into the steering wheel, and he is knocked unconscious.

# Levi

The roar of his motorcycle echoes off of the valley of buildings, tearing down the street, he weaves in and out between the slow, self-driving cars.  Like everything, this bike is an antique, but in perfect repair.  Back in the '10s, the Magpul Ronin was a fabled bike, pushing the design of the motorcycle forward, a concept piece that went into production in the last '10s.  Only a small handful were made, but they were solid bikes.  He spent a year faithfully restoring this bike.  He loves it more than he loves his daughter.

Nakitashi has the autodrive systems set to slower than average speeds. He pontificated that the slow speeds are to induce a sense of tranquility into the city, a sense of not needing to rush around and be busy.  Akio Nakitashi is full of shit.

But Levi uses the slow speeds and ample spacing to zip through the streets.  The prison is an underground facility on the outskirts of Nakitashi City, stretching miles under the desert borderlands of the city.  He pulls up to a low, squat building, a polished black exterior, absorbing the light like it absorbs the criminal element of the city.

Like most prisons in the UCSA, criminal is decided by the corporation.  Anyone who works against the corporate interests of the respective corporations are subject to imprisonment for indefinite amounts of time.  The only regulation the UCSA imposes on the prison system is about the use of torture.  Physical torture is never allowed.

He pulls the bike to a stop parallel to the building in the small amount of shade the building provides.  Whipping his leg over the motorcycle, he walks over to the door, and swipes his wrist against the security sensor.  A series of beeps, the whir of unseen electric motors, and the door slides open.  The pressure differential blows through his short black hair, and he walks in.

A second door sits just within the first, enough room for two people to stand.  The outer door slides shut.  A voice echoes in the little room.

"Identify,"  the voice robotic with a hint of a British accent.

"Private Aiden Maksimov, reporting for transfer."

A brief pause and the door slides open.  A man with a face like a relief map, scored deep with age and weather stands on the other side of the door.

"A bit old for a private, arentcha?"

"Transferred from another company, must start at the bottom rungs, Sir."

"What was your previous rank?"

"General."

"Don't think you will be running the show around here, private."

"I understand the order of things, Sir.  Rank is Rank."

"Indeed.  At ease, private."

Levi spreads his legs slightly, arms behind his back.  *This is going to be a long con to get this kid out of here.*

"What company did you say you are coming from?"

"I didn't, Sir, explicit instructions to not discuss it from the extraction team, Sir."

"Come now, private, your commanding officer supersedes all other orders."

"No, Sir, NDA requires me, under microinjection implant, to not discuss this."

"Very well, private.  Follow me."

Levi is led around, given the grand tour, at the end of the tour is the large steel door leading to the isolation cells.  The yellow stenciled letters spell out "High Security Clearance Personnel Only."

"These are the isolation cells.  Reserved for the worst offenders and protective custody.  You don't have clearance to enter there, so our tour will end now.  Head back to the security center, talk to the PIC up there, and they will give you an assignment."

"Yes, Sir," Levi snaps, a quick salute, and he falls back down the corridor.  *This'll take me a few days.*

# Max

A signal from the central processing center signals the stunpatch to release its hold on Max.  Within a few minutes, his eyes flutter open.  He is inside of a cube.  The walls are smooth slate gray, with no discernible cracks in them to hint at a door.  A small ventilation grate is dead center in the roof, three meters from each wall.  He is laying on a foam mattress in one of the corners.

He cannot move his body.  The stunpatch releases the mind first, then the body slowly as the electrical restraint releases its hold on the nervous system.   The time ticks by, eyes focused on the grate in the ceiling.  An eternity passes with the grate as his only companion, the sound of air trickling in from the grate the only song his ears know.

His fingers twitch, and then his arm moves.  He pushes himself up.  The cube is gray on gray. The mattress is gray, the cold aluminum of the toilet and sink along the wall his head now rests is gray.  The absence of color is nothing new with Nakitashi.

He needs to urinate.  He tries to move his legs, but they are still in the confines of the stunpatch.  His hands search, trying to find the bastardly little device that Ji slapped on him.  He finds it on the back of his leg, behind his knee, and yanks it off.  His legs suddenly work.

Standing up, legs trembling beneath him, he makes his way to the toilet, unbuttons, and let's loose a torrent of urine into the toilet.  A sigh escapes his lips, and he's done.

He looks around at his confinement.  *If the toilet is facing this way* he turns around the commode. *Then this is the portal*  He presses his face near the wall opposite the toilet, peering into the gray.

"I know you are out there."  He knocks on the wall.  The gray shimmers slightly when he touches it.  "I demand to see Ji Go."  The wall sparks slightly, knocking him back to the ground.  He slaps the cold gray stone. "Fuck!"

# Dominic

The flash of red and blue lights pound into Dominic's eyes rousing him from his unconscious state.  With his eyes now open, he can tell there are three varying patterns, interweaving their own blue and red lights.

His hands are roughly pinioned behind his back, a small strip of steel plastic encircle his wrists.  He can hear the hoarse voice of a woman speaking. "Dominic Quinn, midlevel engineer, cohabitating with Maximilian Bosko for the last four years." A radio voice, indiscernibly words buzzing out of the radio. "CPC says the car denied taking him to the prison. Found autodrive system ripped out. We assume he was attempting to self-drive to the prison." More buzzing from the radio. "He is not licenses for vehicle control."

A second voice with youthful exuberance pipes up. "Ma'am, he's awake."

"Dispatch, please hold."

The woman appears in front of Dominic, at the end of the squad car where he is slung.  She is middle aged with laugh lines heavily creasing the sides of her face.  Her stringy brown hair spills out of her patrol cap as she takes it off and squats down to get to his level.  Her knees pop loudly as she sinks down.  Her nameplate reads "Bahr".

"What were you thinking?"

"My boyfriend was taken to prison, I was trying to go find out what happened to him."

"Why didn't you go through proper channels.  There are procedures.  You know this.  Your record shows that you helped implement the current system."

Tears stream down from Dominic's eyes.

"I'm just so worried about him."

The radio buzzes.  The young officer comes over and whispers something into the woman's ear.  Dominic gets a good look at him.  Blond, Fit, bright shining blue eyes, but he looks distinctly Japanese, a contrast to his aryan coloring.   His nameplate labels him "Jones".

The woman's face turns stone cold. "How did you break the security clearance surrounding Max's arrest?  You do not have the clearance."

"I was worried about him."  She strikes him hard against the face.

"How did you know he was arrested?"

"I have friends."  She strikes him again.

"How did you find out he was arrested?"  her voice demanding, carrying a lethal edge of warning.

"I hacked the drone network, bitch, stunpatch packets, pretty easy given the lack of drones out by the prison."  She delivers a heavy blow to his face, closed fist this time.  She picks him up off the back of the squad car, roughly tossing him into the back, and closes the door.

She gets into the passenger seat, and Officer Jones gets into what used to be the driver seat.  

"Well, Mr. Quinn, your desire to see the inside of the prison just might be granted today.  Central Processing," she barks to the autodrive system and the car lurches forward.  "But first, booking."

…

She pulls him to his feet, hauling him out of the squad car.  Central Processing is a spire of a building, slender and impossibly tall.  The top ten floors are offices and the rest of the building is dedicated to the arrays of processors that run Nakitashi's core AI, the system that keeps the city running.

The enormous amounts of heat generated by the processors is dissipated by the paper thin metal fins that cover the top half of the spire.  The spire is open to the wind that sweeps passed in all directions, whisking the heat away from the processing units.  They are mounted on flexible rods, tensions against each other to remain vertical, but flexible to sway and rock in the wind.  The tower takes on the visage of a tentacle during wind storms.

This is the critical point of failure for Nakitashi City, so a reinforced steel lattice structure, large enough to avoid collision during high winds, sheaths the building like an ill-fitting, rigid condom.

The building entrance is a set of large wood and bronze doors rescued from destruction during the New York uprising of 2020 by Nakitashi's father, then magistrate of the former New England states.  They are now held territories of the UCSA, and form the core of its power.

The doors are retrofitted with hydraulic actuators that cause them to swing open as they approach.  Central booking for Nakitashi is housed in the first floor.  He is led with aggressive hands to the first room to the right of the door.  The plastic handcuffs are removed after the door locks behind them.

"Remove your clothing."  Officer Bahr tells him, with a slight upward tick of her chin.

"What?" his brow knits.

"All personal items are removed as part of booking, clothing included.  Now strip, or I will have Officer Jones do it for you."

Heavy breath in and out, and he kicks off his shoes, beginning to unbutton his shirt.  Officer Bahr licks her lips, and Dominic turns away, now staring at Officer Jones who is sorting through forms to find the appropriate paperwork.

Shirt, socks, pants, all fall to the floor.  "Underwear too."  Using his left hand to do his best to cover himself, he slips his underwear to the ground.  Officer Jones eyes dart back to his paperwork.  "Over there for the pictures."

"Pictures?  How is this in line with company policy?"

"It's just mugshots, shut up and go over there, face the far wall."  She points to the white and black striped wall.  Pop of the flash.  "Now face the camera".  Dominic turns.  Pop. "Biometrics scan time.  Eye to that sensor." She points at a round glass sphere on the wall.  It is low, requiring him to bend over slightly.

"Hold out both arms, straight in front of you."  Dominic complies with a roll of his eyes.  "Which hand is your interface sensor in?" She roughly rotates his wrists around.  "Jones, mark down that his interface is in the left wrist."

She takes out two small metal bracelets, dark metal with a matte finish and a small, blinking red light at one end of the open clasp.  She places one on each wrist, closing the clasp.  The red light goes solid, and then changes to magenta.

"These are active restraint systems.  They stop the use of your interface, and allow us to attach you to any appropriate surface in the prison system.  Like so"  She takes his left arm, and presses it against the wall.  Magenta becomes green, and the bracelet fuses with the wall, immovable.  She swipes her wrist against them and they come free.

"If you behave and follow orders, we will not need to use these.  If you don't, you might find yourself hanging from your hands.  Understood?"

Dominic nods, goosebumps spread across his naked flesh.  Officer Jones reappears with a white jumpsuit, handing it to Dominic.  "Put this on," his voice tentative, soft.  Officer Jones casts his eyes down and then quickly pops his eyes back up, flushing his face with blood.  He turns around and goes back to his paperwork.  Dominic smirks, slipping into the white jumpsuit.  As long as it does not get wet, it's a small step above being completely naked.

"Jones, take him to the holding area."

"Yes, Ma'am"

Jones stands behind Dominic and pushes him slight forward.  The door in the far side of the room clicks open, and they push through.  The hallway is lined with a mural depicting the suppressing of the workers rebellion from five years ago.  Police in riot gear, protestors in white masks facing off in Central Park, the background a mist of tear gas.  The protestors carry guns, cudgels, and bottles are being hurtled at the police.  *Propaganda!*

The hallway is empty, and Jones is not in a hurry, his hand lightly pressing into Dominic's back.  "Do you have a boyfriend?"  a smirk crawling across Dominic's face.

Officer Jones blushes again. "No, not right now."

"I think I've seen you at Elysian."

"Maybe."

"I'll buy you a drink once I get out of here."

"Are you trying to bribe me?"

Dominic shakes his head, "You have it wrong.  I don't need to bribe you."  The bracelets click off of his wrists and hit the ground.  His hands are on Officer Jones' mouth is a flash.  He pushes Jones into the bathroom to their right, locking the door behind them.

"You do not know who you are dealing with.  I'm going to pull out the stunpatch on your belt, and attach it to you.  It's going to hurt.  It's going to suck, and I'm sorry for this necessity, but first."  Dominic grabs Officer Jones' wrist, and pushes it against his own.  The indicator screens on both of their wrists flash violently for a brief moment.  His hands run along Jones' hips, searching for the stunpatch while keeping their eyes locked together.  The stunpatch activates as it presses into Jones' neck.

Dominic drags him into the nearby stall and removes his clothes, slipping out of his jumpsuit, and putting on Jones' uniform.  Jones' chest was slimmer that Dominic's, and the buttons strain against the button hole, limiting his arm movements.  He slips Jones into the jumpsuit, closing the stall door behind him.

He slips out of the bathroom, and puts on the patrol cap, looking back down the hall, and then forward.  *I'll have to erase the biometric scan, but for now, must get out of here and get to the prison.*
