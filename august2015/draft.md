# Dominic

Dominic's life is not his own. The stories he tells are a lie. It has been this way for so long that he is becoming a master of believing his own lies, but this is how he makes his living.

The sun is starting to crest the top of Nakitashi Plaza, tracing a laser beam of searing light across his eyes.  Muscles tighten, fractions of a second, and slips out of bed, and begins to pad across the smooth tile floor. He turns back to confirm that Max is still asleep.  Max's form lifeless but for the gentle rising and falling of his breath, and the flutter of his eyelids.  Dominic muses about what dreams are playing behind those eyelids.

The apartment they share is small, not much more than a bedroom. They have a small bathroom, but the shower is down the hall, along with the shared kitchen. Smooth, white space-age polymer tiles cover the floor and walls.  The ceiling is exposed, expanded concrete, reinforced with a lattice work of steel ribbons.  This design was considered modern once.

Dominic shuffles into the bathroom.  Urine streams explosively into the toilet, the sound deafening in the silence of the morning.  He picks a pair of shorts out of the clothes hamper, and slides them on. He flushes and continues out of the apartment.  The only thing on his mind is coffee.  Until that happens, he's not really functional.

It's a religion, a ritual, an incantation. Power, Water, Grind, Fill, Tamp, Extract. It's the only truth he knows at this very moment. The liquid dark and syrupy, frothy golden head. Quick motions and it is down and warming his insides.

The sound of foot steps echo down the hall, and he turns to look.  Ji is rotund. She is also short.  Dominic nods at her and starts to make her a coffee.

"Why are you always naked?"  Her voice is gruff; her accent is slight but still audible to the trained ear.  She wears a yellow jumpsuit with a brown lightening bolt down one side, stretched out over her body.

"I have shorts on." Dominic shrugs as he hands her the coffee.

"Those are barely shorts; I can see your penis." Her words sharp, each syllable pinched off with accusation.  Smoothing into a softer tone, almost pleasant. "Not that I'm complaining."

A slight shake of his head. "Ji…"

"Yeah, I know. You and your boys.  Where is the dainty one?"

A smile creeps across Dominic's face, "Max hates when you call him that.  He's still sleeping.  We are the only morning people in this lovely place."

"Fuck that, I'm not a morning person. I like to see your penis, and you make good coffee."  A hearty laughter erupts from her taking on the form of a deep guttural cough before petering out.

# Max

The smooth silken sheet hangs lightly over Max's long, lithe body. Sunlight bathes the room, reflecting off the white tile, making it impossible for Max to escape it.  It is the time of the morning where the bedroom is stifling hot. The covers cascade to the ground as Max reflectively kicks them off, exposing his body to the sunlight. The sun skips across his naked body.  He rubs his eyes, trying to rouse his senses.  

"Alexis, what time is it?" he calls out.

A small purple ring embedded in the wall begins to pulse, an older model digital assistant is part of the apartment, a perk for Nakitashi corporate housing.  It's slow, but functional.  After a few seconds, the disembodied voice of Alexis responds, "The time is 10:33am. You will be late for work, Max".

Muscles twitch, a quick response, a part of his ritual, perpetually late for work.  Grabbing a towel, he runs out into the common hallway, streaking towards the showers. 

At this time of the day, most people are already at work, so the showers are empty.  Max quickly covers himself in the industrial, multipurpose gel that Nakitashi provides as the most efficient, lowest environmentally impactful cleaning product possible.  The shower fills with a mixture of sulfur and lavender.  This stuff always gives Max a headache for at least an hour.  Another rough morning for the rising star of the biomech division of Nakitashi Corp.

Two minutes are entering the shower, he's toweling himself off as he shuffles his way back to his apartment.  Stepping through the door, Alexis chimes in, "You have received a message from Akio, shall I read it to you?"

Wincing at the name, "yes."  The purple ring pulses languidly as the processor generates the words for Alexis to speak.

"Presentation this morning?  11am, you get here, now"

"Oh fuck!"  Max grabs a pink tee-shirt, a grinning cat sketched across half of it, slipping it over his head.  He pulls on his favorite pair of embedded shorts, a slim black pair with sensors that monitor air quality and muscle activation.  He rushes out the door forgetting to put on his shoes.

He touches the implant on his right wrist lighting up the time under his skin.  The glowing numbers read "10:45am".  15 minutes. He can do this.  Through slight movements of his fingers, he scrolls through menu items to find "car".  A couple more movements and a company car is waiting for him as he exits the corporate housing building.  He gets in the car, and it speeds off to Nakitashi Plaza.

…

11:01am stares at him through the glass of the meeting room walls. His hurried steps continue, throwing open the door, and huffing for air.  All eyes are on him.  Akio stands at the front of the room.  "Ah, just in time.  What do you have for us, Maximilian?"

Sweat drips down into Max's eyes, his finger trembling as he keys his access code into the conference room table.  A holoprojector turns on from above the table.  A deep breath slowly trails out of his mouth, a shuttering release of air.  "Perfect worker compliance" he begins.	

# Vienne

NewTek International Holdings is an umbrella corporation primarily responsible for stealing most of the technological advancements in the last 50 years.  Vienne is a handler for NewTek International Holdings. Her primary responsibility is being the contact person for a small group of spies that NewTek International Holdings employs.  These spies are in deep cover, sometimes years at a time, infiltrating neighboring corporate states, and relaying information back to NewTek so they can beat people to market with new technologies.

Vienne is pacing in her office on the top floor of the KK building, NewTek's espionage wing. They call themselves the Advanced Research Division, but that is just a euphemism. It is common knowledge, but NewTek is too powerful for any other corporate state to try to stop them.

Vienne is pacing because she has not heard from her best agent. He's been undercover for 5 years now.  She bites on her fingernail, cracking it, cursing under her breath.  A large operational monitor covers the entire wall opposite her desk.  Her eyes dart between the monitor and her desk's holographic display.

She leans over and types another message into the console.

"Nic, questioned allegiance. Need to meet. NT Bar, midnight. Pls Rspd"

"That little fucker better not be turning on me."

Simon is standing in the doorway unnoticed.  He clears his throat, and Vienne's eyes lock onto him.  "What?" she snaps.

"The leaders are getting concerned, Madame." His English is rough, unpolished, thick with an uncomfortable accent.  "They are concerned with his length."

"Nic is our best agent.  I'm going to be reasserting his allegiance tonight.  Tell them I have it under control."

"Madame, they fear he is turning."

"He isn't turning.  He's a professional."

"Five years, lies can start becoming real, Madame."

"Not with Nic."

"How can you be sure?"

"He's our best agent."

"Yes, Madame."  Simon touches his ear and stares at the ground for a second.  "They are requesting a full diagnostics report after tonight's rendezvous."

# Dominic

The lab is built in the same way as the corporate housing.  White polymer tiles are a consistent feature everywhere, and for Dominic, they are suffocating today.  He rereads the message, sighing heavily as it flashes across his eyes. The eye implant is undetectable, an advancement that is still a few years away from being available to the general public.

His fingers twiddle across his left wrist, typing out: "Can't, Max will suspect. Mrng Run, 5am, NCP?"

"Fine." flashes.

Dominic returns back to the device sitting on his workbench, rescrewing the access cover, and flipping the switch on. A small puff of smoke rises quickly from the device, and he switches it off again.

…

5am: An electrical signal from his implant stimulates his pituitary gland, beginning a slow increase of cortisol into his blood stream.  The bedroom is dark, but the cortisol speeds up his heart rate, increasing blood flow over his entire system, and his eyes shoot open.  He slips quietly out of bed, puts on his running gear, and slowly closes the door behind him.

Nakitashi Central Park is at the exact middle of the Nakitashi corporate state.  It is the nexus point, the layout of the state funnels into Central Park from all directions.  Legend has it the state is laid out according to some ancient superstitions about placement and energy flow.  Dominic believes it.  Central Park is a magical place, a sanctuary where he can escape who he is, what he is doing, and how he's betraying Max.

Vienne is a tall woman with jet black hair.  He has never seen her wear anything with color, and today is no different.  She leans against a decorative arch, sucking in on a nicostick, the vapor slowly trailing out of her nose.  The light of the predawn just starting to flood in, she is a monochrome vision of the likes of a John Huston film.

She approaches him, and embraces him tightly, kissing him lightly on both cheeks.  "My dear," she whispers into his ear.

"My allegiance is in question?" He gently creates space between them, a small gesture that does not go unnoticed.

"Yes.  The leaders are concerned."

"And?"

"They want a full diagnostics report."

"I'm not some robot."

"Aren't you?"

"Fuck you, Vienne.  You are the one who ended it, not me."

"And now I'm assigned as your handler.  This isn't about us."

"You are right, it's not."

"Are you going to allow me to get the diagnostics report willingly?"

"Yes." He holds out his left wrist, and she takes it. Her fingers travel lightly across his skin.  "Damn her" he thinks as a tingle travels down his spine.

She removes a small device from her pocket.  It's a nondescript black box with two wires dangling from it.  She places the wires on each side of his wrist, and swipes the cover of the box.  "Remember, this will hurt a little." She presses the red X that has appeared on the box, and all of Dominic's muscles tense, eyes clenching against the pain.

His mind shuts down, devoid of all thought, a cycle of colors swirling through his imagination. The colors take on forms and play out scenes from the last five years.  The initial mission briefing. The forced introduction to Max. Their first kiss. Their first date. Being hired at Nakitashi. The entire five years plays out in staccato.

To this very moment, and his body relaxes collapsing to the ground.  Vienne makes no attempt to catch him as he crumples to the ground.  She pulls her foot out from under his head.  Dominic's eyes snap open as she removes the electrodes from his wrist.

"That seemed a bit more painful than usual" a dispassionate calm mingles in with a sense of disgust.

Dominic stands up, his hands, weak from the session, brush the dirt sticking to his clothes.  "Are you sure you had that configured correctly?  It was the full five years."

"That's what they wanted."  She bites her fingernail as she stares at Nakitashi Plaza. "Did it hurt?"

Dominic kneads the back of his neck, working out the tension that is building there.  "It's going to hurt tomorrow."

"You better run along."  She touches her ear for a brief moment. "They say they want the plans for Project Unicorn, and that once stolen, they should be destroyed."

"Project Unicorn is Max's project."

"They know, their other intel sources within Nakitashi said that it is something we would be interested in keeping out of the hands of any other corporation. Too much potential.  You have your orders.  When it's complete, steal it, destroy all copies within Nakitashi, and return the plans to us."

"And then what? Max will be devastated."

"Then your mission will be complete and you can leave him."

Dominic's eyes drift to the ground, and he blinks back tears, hoping Vienne does not see, does not interpret.

"Nic, Is your mission compromised by attachment to your mark?"

Head down, he looks up at Vienne, locking eyes. "En, my mission is not compromised by attachment."

"Good, I'd hate to tell you what it meant we'd have to do next."

"Are we done here?"  She nods, and he jogs away.

# Max

Max believes he is psychic. It is a stupid belief, but his mother swears it runs in the family. His grandmother and great grandmother also believed. They say it usually is handed down to the women in the family, but once in a great while, a man gets it.  The men in the family usually are not as powerful as the women, but nevertheless, the men get feels, and right now, Max has a feeling.

The apartment is deathly quiet with Max sitting up in bed, goosebumps growing down his arms, spreading across his chest, and down his back.  It is the feeling of something bad coming.  It is 6am, and Dominic is not here which worries Max.  Dominic's routine is different today; Max instinctively feels it is wrong.

A knock on the door breaks the silence; three sharp raps echo off the smooth polished tiles.  Max jumps slightly with each knock, in a stupor, a dangerous mix of not being a morning person and having too much on his mind.  He pops out of bed, walking to the door, signaling it to open.  Ji, the loud mouth Chinese girl who works in Structural, stands with her hands on her hips.  The same yellow jumpsuit she always wears in the morning strains against her body.

"Oh, now I see why Dominic likes you."

"What?"

"Your penis."  Max looks down, so preoccupied he forgot to put clothes on, he does his best to cover himself with his hands, and retreats into the bathroom, throwing on a pair of shorts.

Ji has come into the apartment and is surveying the surroundings.  The room is mostly clean, a small nightstand with a digital book sits to one side of the ample bed.  Like all Nakitashi employee apartments, everything is glaring white; color is an extravagance that Nakitashi believes serves no purpose.

"What do you want, Ji?  It's quite early."

"I know, Dominic usually makes me coffee, but he wasn't here this morning.  Where is he?"

"I don't know" his brow furrows, and he massages his right deltoid for a moment before he notices and stops.

"Fuck, I don't know how to make coffee."

"Sorry."

"Whatever, dainty,"  and she leaves, the door slides closed behind her.

Max glares at the closed door and grumbles.

# Ji

Ji's apartment is covered in color. A vibrant mural of colors melding and mutating sprawl across the walls, ceiling, and floor.  As she enters, the lights start to flicker and fade.  The hacked digital assistant, overclocked, draws power from the lighting system to improve its abilities.

"Fucker, lock down protocol 12."

"Yes mistress" the digital assistant in subservient, but sultry male voice.  The cachunk of a heavy gauge lock slots into place, and the lights dim further.  "Full signal encryption enabled, opening channel to handler."

A viewscreen appears from behind the one tile that is not covered in paint.  Vienne's face slowly fades onto the screen as it adjusts the brightness to the room.  A scowl, almost ever present when Ji is talking to her, appears on her face.

"What do you want, Ji?  This is highly unusual."

"My mark is outside of his usual routine."

"Not something to be concerned with, and not something that required my immediate attention."

"Sorry, but what should I do?"

"Agent, you are capable of acting autonomously without our direct guidance.  What do you feel you should do?"

"I don't know."

Vienne types a few things on her console, out of sight, but audible.  "Our intel shows that he went on a morning run."

"But why?"

"That's for you to find out.  Ji, are you doing okay?  This is your first mission, so it's understandable that you might not have all the answers, we understand."

"I'm fine. The mission is fine. it's great."

"Ji, we have complete faith in your abilities. When things deviate, just file a report, preferably using form sixty-eight stroke A one."

"Sure."

"Good.  Bye."  The viewscreen fades to cerulean blue.  "Fucker, hallway view," and the screen bursts back into life, showing a view of the hallway just in time to see Dominic walk into the hallway, exhausted steps lingering, trailing down the hallway.  It takes him forever to reach his door.

She continues to watch.  It is only moments before he is back out the door, towel wrapped around him, as he shuffles down the hall in shower shoes.  "Fucker, reset".  The room lights return back to normal, and the lock cachunks back open.  Her hurried steps carry her to the door and through it, bumping directly into Dominic.

"Oh, crap, I'm sorry." she mutters, avoiding his eyes.

"Ji, sorry I didn't make the coffee. I went for a run. I was coming to tell you I'll make you some after I shower."

"Oh, it's okay."

"Max said you came by looking for me."

"Yeah…"

"I'll shower quickly."

"Okay."

He turns around and continues down the hallway to shower.  Blood rushes to her face, causing crimson waves of heat to flush over her.  She watches has the muscles of his back undulate as he walks toward the showers.  The tattoo of a serpent curled around a sword seems alive as his shoulder blades crest and fall with his arms swinging.

# Vienne

Ji's face fades off of the holographic display.  Vienne sits back in her chair, body heavy and sinking into the supple nano-impregnated faux leather cushions which respond to the shift in pressure with agile little fingers, adjusting to support, cradle, and caress.

A slender woman is sitting military straight in the chair across the desk.  The morning sun drenches her golden curls turning them into a blazing cascade of honey.  She wears a name tag which reads "Alexandrine Brant, Governess of the United Corporate States of America."

"Sorry for the interruption.  Ji is one of our newest agents working in the field.  She has great potential, but doubts herself too much."

"It is quite alright. It's important to make time for your employees, and to make them feel they are valuable members of your team."  Her voice thick with Bavarian influences.

"Indeed.  Now where were we?"

"You were just about to brief me on this Project Unicorn nonsense."

"Ah yes. Project Unicorn. From our initial intel, it is a reprogramming and mind control technology that was previous thought to be impossible."

"Reprogramming?"

"Yes, if our intel is correct, Nakitashi is expecting to use it to induce complete company loyalty, squashing the worker rebellions once and for all.  This is troubling technology.  They could raise an army and would be in complete control of every unit.  This would undermine everything the UCSA has been working towards for the last ten years.
