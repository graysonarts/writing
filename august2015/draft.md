# Dominic

Dominic's life is not his own. The stories he tells are a lie. It has been this way for so long that he is becoming a master of believing his own lies, but this is how he makes his living.

The sun is starting to crest the top of Nakitashi Plaza, tracing a laser beam of searing light across his eyes.  Muscles tighten, fractions of a second, and slips out of bed, and begins to pad across the smooth tile floor. He turns back to confirm that Max is still asleep.  Max's form lifeless but for the gentle rising and falling of his breath, and the flutter of his eyelids.  Dominic muses about what dreams are playing behind those eyelids.

The apartment they share is small, not much more than a bedroom. They have a small bathroom, but the shower is down the hall, along with the shared kitchen. Smooth, white space-age polymer tiles cover the floor and walls.  The ceiling is exposed, expanded concrete, reinforced with a lattice work of steel ribbons.  This design was considered modern once.

Dominic shuffles into the bathroom.  Urine streams explosively into the toilet, the sound deafening in the silence of the morning.  He picks a pair of shorts out of the clothes hamper, and slides them on. He flushes and continues out of the apartment.  The only thing on his mind is coffee.  Until that happens, he's not really functional.

It's a religion, a ritual, an incantation. Power, Water, Grind, Fill, Tamp, Extract. It's the only truth he knows at this very moment. The liquid dark and syrupy, frothy golden head. Quick motions and it is down and warming his insides.

The sound of foot steps echo down the hall, and he turns to look.  Ji is rotund. She is also short.  Dominic nods at her and starts to make her a coffee.

"Why are you always naked?"  Her voice is gruff; her accent is slight but still audible to the trained ear.  She wears a yellow jumpsuit with a brown lightening bolt down one side, stretched out over her body.

"I have shorts on." Dominic shrugs as he hands her the coffee.

"Those are barely shorts; I can see your penis." Her words sharp, each syllable pinched off with accusation.  Smoothing into a softer tone, almost pleasant. "Not that I'm complaining."

A slight shake of his head. "Ji…"

"Yeah, I know. You and your boys.  Where is the dainty one?"

A smile creeps across Dominic's face, "Max hates when you call him that.  He's still sleeping.  We are the only morning people in this lovely place."

"Fuck that, I'm not a morning person. I like to see your penis, and you make good coffee."  A hearty laughter erupts from her taking on the form of a deep guttural cough before petering out.

# Levi

Levi Kane, previously a one star general in the now defunct New Cascadia Army sleeps in a make shift shelter cobbled together out of the left over parts of a sun-bleached Impala, the aging interior crusty with wind blown sand, a fine powder of abrasion having worn the leather into a dull shine. The vibration of his silent alarm stirs him awake, and with deft movements, he is standing, sunglasses slamming onto his face.  The extraction is set for 6am, and 5:45am blinks languidly out from the lenses in a crisp red readout.

He pulls up the dossier for his extract target, reading over the details of a midlevel human interaction engineer from a no name division in what used to be Utah.  "This woman isn't even worth the cost of this extraction," he mutters to the emptiness of the desert.

The rumble of a motorcade echoes out across valley, bouncing off of the mesas surrounding the valley.  *Showtime*.  He quickly reviews the parameters of the mission. *one handler, two guards, three cars, all self-driven*.  He smirks. *too easy*.  He pulls out a small cylindrical device with a comically sized red button on it. He has a flair for the dramatic, and loves the aesthetics of movies from before the turn of the century.  Etched into the turned aluminum body of the device are the letters E, M, and P in a humanist san-serif font, bold, but not too overpowering.

He waits, in the cover of his shelter.  The sound dopplers in as the motorcade gets closer.  The detonation device is buried under the road right where they are charted to turn.  The recon data suggests that she is in the middle car, so the plan is to detonate the device when the first car passes. *come on, you lazy sonofabitch, faster* he clenches his jaw, shaking his leg for extra emphasis. *Just a little more*.

The first car passes over the spot, slowing to make the turn down the side road.  He presses in the plunger, and a shockwave of compressed sound rushes across the valley, and all three cars stop in their tracks.  In five quick strides, he is across the road, gun drawn.  Bang.  Light, silent steps, up and over the middle car. Bang. Bang. Rebound onto the middle car's roof. Crash, the windows cave in. Bang.  A woman screams, echoing repeatedly off the sandstone walls that box them in.  "You work for Nakitashi now."

# Max

The smooth silken sheet hangs lightly over Max's long, lithe body. Sunlight bathes the room, reflecting off the white tile, making it impossible for Max to escape it.  It is the time of the morning where the bedroom is stifling hot. The covers cascade to the ground as Max reflectively kicks them off, exposing his body to the sunlight. The sun skips across his naked body.  He rubs his eyes, trying to rouse his senses.  

"Alexis, what time is it?" he calls out.

A small purple ring embedded in the wall begins to pulse, an older model digital assistant is part of the apartment, a perk for Nakitashi corporate housing.  It's slow, but functional.  After a few seconds, the disembodied voice of Alexis responds, "The time is 10:33am. You will be late for work, Max".

Muscles twitch, a quick response, a part of his ritual, perpetually late for work.  Grabbing a towel, he runs out into the common hallway, streaking towards the showers. 

At this time of the day, most people are already at work, so the showers are empty.  Max quickly covers himself in the industrial, multipurpose gel that Nakitashi provides as the most efficient, lowest environmentally impactful cleaning product possible.  The shower fills with a mixture of sulfur and lavender.  This stuff always gives Max a headache for at least an hour.  Another rough morning for the rising star of the biomech division of Nakitashi Corp.

Two minutes are entering the shower, he's toweling himself off as he shuffles his way back to his apartment.  Stepping through the door, Alexis chimes in, "You have received a message from Akio Nakitashi, shall I read it to you?"

Wincing at the name, "yes."  The purple ring pulses languidly as the processor generates the words for Alexis to speak.

"Presentation this morning?  11am, you get here, now"

"Oh fuck!"  Max grabs a pink tee-shirt, a grinning cat sketched across half of it, slipping it over his head.  He pulls on his favorite pair of embedded shorts, a slim black pair with sensors that monitor air quality and muscle activation.  He rushes out the door forgetting to put on his shoes.

He touches the implant on his right wrist lighting up the time under his skin.  The glowing numbers read "10:45am".  15 minutes. He can do this.  Through slight movements of his fingers, he scrolls through menu items to find "car".  A couple more movements and a company car is waiting for him as he exits the corporate housing building.  He gets in the car, and it speeds off to Nakitashi Plaza.

***

11:01am stares at him through the glass of the meeting room walls. His hurried steps continue, throwing open the door, and huffing for air.  All eyes are on him.  Akio Nakitashi stands at the front of the room.  "Ah, just in time.  What do you have for us, Maximilian?"

Sweat drips down into Max's eyes, his finger trembling as he keys his access code into the conference room table.  A holoprojector turns on from above the table.  A deep breath slowly trails out of his mouth, a shuttering release of air.  "Perfect worker loyalty" he begins.

# Ji
Ji stands out on the balcony of the 54th floor of the Nakitashi Plaza building.  A nicostick dangles from her lips, her left hand pressed the wall, steading herself.  Her eyes are unfocused, a direct audio feed from Akio's meeting room sends pulses directly to her cochlear nerve, presenting a sound that is more real than real life, and cannot be eavesdropped on, except by electrical means.  If one inspected the device close enough, with an electron microscope, they would see "NewTek International Holdings" emblazoned on it.

A long drag on the nicostick, and Ji's hands steady, her breathing lengthens.  She leans back against the wall, looking out onto Nakitashi City, the capitol of Nakitashi Corporate Land Holdings, LTD, the liability shelter setup after Akio Nakitashi purchased the failed New Cascadia, one of the last bastions of democracy, the last hold out against the UCSA and their power. 

Nakitashi City is not very big, but the natural formation of hills separate the city into distinct zones.   The crumbling ruins of the old city stretch between Lake Akio and the Wide Fjord of Advancement, a large stretch of water being fed by the Pacific Ocean.

The original denizens of the old city could not agree on the style of the city. The ruins are a hodgepodge of baroque facades with the amorphous shapes of the early 21st centuries concepts of modern, monstrosities of aluminum, glass, and unmatched colors.

Ji's eyes fixate on the one penis shaped structure, a spindled spire, that abruptly ends in fractured edges, giving hint of incompleteness.  As a kid, she learned that it was once called a needle, but all she sees is a broken penis.

# Dominic
Dominic pounces on Max as soon as the door slides open, arms around Max's waist, tight, pulling.  "I heard that your project was greenlit!"  He kisses Max, a deep passionate kiss.  Max drops the bag he was holding.

Max pulls back, disengaging, breathing a deep solid breath. "How did you hear?  It's supposed to be top secret."  His eyes narrow, gazing with intensity.

"Oh, I overheard someone saying that you were a lucky sonofabitch, saying you probably fucked Mr Nashitaki to get the green light.  The normal office bullshit."

"Jealous, bitter hags."

"Let's celebrate!" He pulls Max into him harder, pulling him over to the bed.  They fall backwards, the soft foam of the bed catching their weight with effortless ease.

"Oh? Is this what you want?" Max says has he unbuttons Dominic's pants.

***

Two naked bodies intertwined, sweat glistens off of their chests as deep breathing begins to slow, a lurid mixture of sweat and sex permeates the air.  With a heavy sigh, Dominic pulls himself free, become separate entities again.  He stands up, and walks to the bathroom, Max reaches out in vain to stop him. "Come back here."

"I'm going shower, need to wash all of this off of me" he jesters to his chest and neck.

Max sits up in bed, crossing his arms and pouting as Dominic continues to the bathroom.  He flicks the shower to hot, then cold, trying to find the perfect temperature.  The water rushes over him, warming his body against the cold evening air.  Lather, rise, repeat, his hands glide over his body, covering every crevice, scouring away the remnants of their passion.

He becomes lost in himself as the water ebbs and flows over his back, ears filling and emptying as water winds its way down his body.  

"Hey, there is a new club opening up, pansexual, each floor has a different theme.  Let's go tonight?"  Max calls from outside the bathroom door, the sound muffled by the water in Dominic's ears.

"Sure, sounds fun." Dominic shuts off the water valve, and steps out of the shower, water dripping and pooling on the floor.  He palms the door open, Max's eyes travel the length of his body, lingering on his crotch.

"Up for round two?"

***

The exterior of Club Elysium has a mirror finish and no exterior lighting except the sign.  An orgy of colors swirl and dance above the building and over the street surrounding Elysium.  The reflections bath Dominic and Max is a multitude of hues.  The door is imperceptible, a thin etched line in the otherwise continuous mirrored facade.  As they approach the door, the light from the sign coalesces into concentrated beams  of magenta, either pupils scanned.

Club Elysium is another part of the wide, suffocating embrace of the Nakitashi Corporation.  Their employee IDs are whisked away, through optical fibers to the central data processing hub.  A log entry in their personal file is created, timestamped, with accompanying pictures, taken from a hidden camera behind the mirrors of the club.

The door slides open, and the bass washes over them, an aural tidal wave, assaulting their vestibular system, inducing a euphoric, light-headed feeling.  The walk on into a panoramic view of the inside of the club.  It's an open air atrium with a five story ramp circumscribing the perimeter of the atrium.

The DJ station floats on tensioned aircraft steel in the center of the atrium, and a pair of robots sit at turntables, mixing the music using algorithms that moderate the energy levels of the crowd, remotely monitoring their biosigns, adjusting and manipulating to keep the crowd engage and amused.

"Want to get a drink?" Max screams into Dominic's ear, trying to overcome the music.  They walk over to a drink console.  Dominic selects gin and tonic, and Max selects scotch, neat.  Their drinks are dispensed by unseen pumps and mechanical arms.  They appear on the outstretched tray moments later.

Performers dangle everywhere around the DJ station, contorting and manipulating their bodies around pieces of steel, rope, and fabric. Their naked bodies dripping sweat into the crowd as they fling themselves around, upside down, and drop.

Dominic leans over to Max, mouth to his ear, pointing at one of the performers, "I bet he gets wicked rope burns on his ass."  They both laugh.

"But he has a pretty fantastic ass."  Dominic nods his head.  "I wonder what time he is done performing?"

"Why?"  heads swinging back and forth so they can hear each other.

"He'd be fun in bed.  Look how bendy he is."

"What?"

"I said, he'd be fun in bed!"

"Oh."  Dominic looks down at the ground, shifting his weight from one foot to the other, taking a sip of his drink.  A brief respite in the intensity of the music, slowing, softening, but the pianissimo is but a brief moment in time before the full brunt of the bass line pounds into them.

# Vienne

NewTek International Holdings is an umbrella corporation primarily responsible for stealing most of the technological advancements in the last 50 years.  Vienne is a handler for NewTek International Holdings. Her primary responsibility is being the contact person for a small group of spies that NewTek International Holdings employs.  These spies are in deep cover, sometimes years at a time, infiltrating neighboring corporate states, and relaying information back to NewTek so they can beat people to market with new technologies.

Vienne is pacing in her office on the top floor of the KK building, NewTek's espionage wing. They call themselves the Advanced Research Division, but that is just a euphemism. It is common knowledge, but NewTek is too powerful for any other corporate state to try to stop them.

Vienne is pacing because she has not heard from her best agent. He's been undercover for 5 years now.  She bites on her fingernail, cracking it, cursing under her breath.  A large operational monitor covers the entire wall opposite her desk.  Her eyes dart between the monitor and her desk's holographic display.

She leans over and types another message into the console.

"Nic, questioned allegiance. Need to meet. NT Bar, midnight. Pls Rspd"

"That little fucker better not be turning on me."

Simon is standing in the doorway unnoticed.  He clears his throat, and Vienne's eyes lock onto him.  "What?" she snaps.

"The leaders are getting concerned, Madame." His English is rough, unpolished, thick with an uncomfortable accent.  "They are concerned with his length."

"Nic is our best agent.  I'm going to be reasserting his allegiance tonight.  Tell them I have it under control."

"Madame, they fear he is turning."

"He isn't turning.  He's a professional."

"Five years, lies can start becoming real, Madame."

"Not with Nic."

"How can you be sure?"

"He's our best agent."

"Yes, Madame."  Simon touches his ear and stares at the ground for a second.  "They are requesting a full diagnostics report after tonight's rendezvous."

# Dominic

The lab is built in the same way as the corporate housing.  White polymer tiles are a consistent feature everywhere, and for Dominic, they are suffocating today.  He rereads the message, sighing heavily as it flashes across his eyes. The eye implant is undetectable, an advancement that is still a few years away from being available to the general public.

His fingers twiddle across his left wrist, typing out: "Can't, Max will suspect. Mrng Run, 5am, NCP?"

"Fine." flashes.

Dominic returns back to the device sitting on his workbench, rescrewing the access cover, and flipping the switch on. A small puff of smoke rises quickly from the device, and he switches it off again.

***

5am: An electrical signal from his implant stimulates his pituitary gland, beginning a slow increase of cortisol into his blood stream.  The bedroom is dark, but the cortisol speeds up his heart rate, increasing blood flow over his entire system, and his eyes shoot open.  He slips quietly out of bed, puts on his running gear, and slowly closes the door behind him.

Nakitashi Central Park is at the exact middle of the Nakitashi corporate state.  It is the nexus point, the layout of the state funnels into Central Park from all directions.  Legend has it the state is laid out according to some ancient superstitions about placement and energy flow.  Dominic believes it.  Central Park is a magical place, a sanctuary where he can escape who he is, what he is doing, and how he's betraying Max.

Vienne is a tall woman with jet black hair.  He has never seen her wear anything with color, and today is no different.  She leans against a decorative arch, sucking in on a nicostick, the vapor slowly trailing out of her nose.  The light of the predawn just starting to flood in, she is a monochrome vision of the likes of a John Huston film.

She approaches him, and embraces him tightly, kissing him lightly on both cheeks.  "My dear," she whispers into his ear.

"My allegiance is in question?" He gently creates space between them, a small gesture that does not go unnoticed.

"Yes.  The leaders are concerned."

"And?"

"They want a full diagnostics report."

"I'm not some robot."

"Aren't you?"

"Fuck you, Vienne.  You are the one who ended it, not me."

"And now I'm assigned as your handler.  This isn't about us."

"You are right, it's not."

"Are you going to allow me to get the diagnostics report willingly?"

"Yes." He holds out his left wrist, and she takes it. Her fingers travel lightly across his skin.  *Damn her* a tingle travels down his spine.

She removes a small device from her pocket.  It's a nondescript black box with two wires dangling from it.  She places the wires on each side of his wrist, and swipes the cover of the box.  "Remember, this will hurt a little." She presses the red X that has appeared on the box, and all of Dominic's muscles tense, eyes clenching against the pain.

His mind shuts down, devoid of all thought, a cycle of colors swirling through his imagination. The colors take on forms and play out scenes from the last five years.  The initial mission briefing. The forced introduction to Max. Their first kiss. Their first date. Being hired at Nakitashi. The entire five years plays out in staccato.

To this very moment, and his body relaxes collapsing to the ground.  Vienne makes no attempt to catch him as he crumples to the ground.  She pulls her foot out from under his head.  Dominic's eyes snap open as she removes the electrodes from his wrist.

"That seemed a bit more painful than usual" a dispassionate calm mingles in with a sense of disgust.

Dominic stands up, his hands, weak from the session, brush the dirt sticking to his clothes.  "Are you sure you had that configured correctly?  It was the full five years."

"That's what they wanted."  She bites her fingernail as she stares at Nakitashi Plaza. "Did it hurt?"

Dominic kneads the back of his neck, working out the tension that is building there.  "It's going to hurt tomorrow."

"You better run along."  She touches her ear for a brief moment. "They say they want the plans for Project Unicorn, and that once stolen, they should be destroyed."

"Project Unicorn is Max's project."

"They know, their other intel sources within Nakitashi said that it is something we would be interested in keeping out of the hands of any other corporation. Too much potential.  You have your orders.  When it's complete, steal it, destroy all copies within Nakitashi, and return the plans to us."

"And then what? Max will be devastated."

"Then your mission will be complete and you can leave him."

Dominic's eyes drift to the ground, and he blinks back tears, hoping Vienne does not see, does not interpret.

"Nic, Is your mission compromised by attachment to your mark?"

Head down, he looks up at Vienne, locking eyes. "En, my mission is not compromised by attachment."

"Good, I'd hate to tell you what it meant we'd have to do next."

"Are we done here?"  She nods, and he jogs away.

# Max

Max believes he is psychic. It is a stupid belief, but his mother swears it runs in the family. His grandmother and great grandmother also believed. They say it usually is handed down to the women in the family, but once in a great while, a man gets it.  The men in the family usually are not as powerful as the women, but nevertheless, the men get feels, and right now, Max has a feeling.

The apartment is deathly quiet with Max sitting up in bed, goosebumps growing down his arms, spreading across his chest, and down his back.  It is the feeling of something bad coming.  It is 6am, and Dominic is not here which worries Max.  Dominic's routine is different today; Max instinctively feels it is wrong.

A knock on the door breaks the silence; three sharp raps echo off the smooth polished tiles.  Max jumps slightly with each knock, in a stupor, a dangerous mix of not being a morning person and having too much on his mind.  He pops out of bed, walking to the door, signaling it to open.  Ji, the loud mouth Chinese girl who works in Structural, stands with her hands on her hips.  The same yellow jumpsuit she always wears in the morning strains against her body.

"Oh, now I see why Dominic likes you."

"What?"

"Your penis."  Max looks down, so preoccupied he forgot to put clothes on, he does his best to cover himself with his hands, and retreats into the bathroom, throwing on a pair of shorts.

Ji has come into the apartment and is surveying the surroundings.  The room is mostly clean, a small nightstand with a digital book sits to one side of the ample bed.  Like all Nakitashi employee apartments, everything is glaring white; color is an extravagance that Nakitashi believes serves no purpose.

"What do you want, Ji?  It's quite early."

"I know, Dominic usually makes me coffee, but he wasn't here this morning.  Where is he?"

"I don't know" his brow furrows, and he massages his right deltoid for a moment before he notices and stops.

"Fuck, I don't know how to make coffee."

"Sorry."

"Whatever, dainty,"  and she leaves, the door slides closed behind her.

Max glares at the closed door and grumbles.

# Ji

Ji's apartment is covered in color. A vibrant mural of colors melding and mutating sprawl across the walls, ceiling, and floor.  As she enters, the lights start to flicker and fade.  The hacked digital assistant, overclocked, draws power from the lighting system to improve its abilities.

"Fucker, lock down protocol 12."

"Yes mistress" the digital assistant in subservient, but sultry male voice.  The cachunk of a heavy gauge lock slots into place, and the lights dim further.  "Full signal encryption enabled, opening channel to handler."

A viewscreen appears from behind the one tile that is not covered in paint.  Vienne's face slowly fades onto the screen as it adjusts the brightness to the room.  A scowl, almost ever present when Ji is talking to her, appears on her face.

"What do you want, Ji?  This is highly unusual."

"My mark is outside of his usual routine."

"Not something to be concerned with, and not something that required my immediate attention."

"Sorry, but what should I do?"

"Agent, you are capable of acting autonomously without our direct guidance.  What do you feel you should do?"

"I don't know."

Vienne types a few things on her console, out of sight, but audible.  "Our intel shows that he went on a morning run."

"But why?"

"That's for you to find out.  Ji, are you doing okay?  This is your first mission, so it's understandable that you might not have all the answers, we understand."

"I'm fine. The mission is fine. it's great."

"Ji, we have complete faith in your abilities. When things deviate, just file a report, preferably using form sixty-eight stroke A one."

"Sure."

"Good.  Bye."  The viewscreen fades to cerulean blue.  "Fucker, hallway view," and the screen bursts back into life, showing a view of the hallway just in time to see Dominic walk into the hallway, exhausted steps lingering, trailing down the hallway.  It takes him forever to reach his door.

She continues to watch.  It is only moments before he is back out the door, towel wrapped around him, as he shuffles down the hall in shower shoes.  "Fucker, reset".  The room lights return back to normal, and the lock cachunks back open.  Her hurried steps carry her to the door and through it, bumping directly into Dominic.

"Oh, crap, I'm sorry." she mutters, avoiding his eyes.

"Ji, sorry I didn't make the coffee. I went for a run. I was coming to tell you I'll make you some after I shower."

"Oh, it's okay."

"Max said you came by looking for me."

"Yeah…"

"I'll shower quickly."

"Okay."

He turns around and continues down the hallway to shower.  Blood rushes to her face, causing crimson waves of heat to flush over her.  She watches has the muscles of his back undulate as he walks toward the showers.  The tattoo of a serpent curled around a sword seems alive as his shoulder blades crest and fall with his arms swinging.

# Vienne

Ji's face fades off of the holographic display.  Vienne sits back in her chair, body heavy and sinking into the supple nano-impregnated faux leather cushions which respond to the shift in pressure with agile little fingers, adjusting to support, cradle, and caress.

A slender woman is sitting military straight in the chair across the desk.  The morning sun drenches her golden curls turning them into a blazing cascade of honey.  She wears a name tag which reads "Alexandrine Brant, Governess of the United Corporate States of America."

"Sorry for the interruption.  Ji is one of our newest agents working in the field.  She has great potential, but doubts herself too much."

"It is quite all right. It's important to make time for your employees, and to make them feel they are valuable members of your team."  Her voice thick with Bavarian influences.

"Indeed.  Now where were we?"

"You were just about to brief me on this Project Unicorn nonsense."

"Ah yes. Project Unicorn. From our initial intel, it is a reprogramming and mind control technology that was previous thought to be impossible."

"Reprogramming?"

"Yes, if our intel is correct, Nakitashi is expecting to use it to induce complete company loyalty, squashing the worker rebellions once and for all.  This is troubling technology.  They could raise an army and would be in complete control of every unit.  This would undermine everything the UCSA has been working towards for the last ten years."

Alexandrine shifts her weight in the chair, face scrunching, shifts a second time, and then stands, walking towards the window, eyes fixed on the horizon.

"And you have agents on all the key players for this project?"

"Fortune has favored us.  The principal researcher  on Project Unicorn was someone we had earmarked for forceful defection at some point in the future.  One of our best agents is currently infiltrated as his lover for the past four years."

Alexandrine nods slowly, fingers tapping on the window, eye blank and glazing over as she considers this new information.  "And you've ordered the device plans retrieved and destroyed?"

"Retrieve a copy, destroy the original, bring the copy here."

"And what of the researcher?"

Vienne takes a deep breath. "We hope he'll be too devastated from the betrayal that he will never try to make the device again."

Alexandrine turns sharply around.  "Not good enough.  Kill or Capture.  These are, of course, strictly off the record recommendations.  As Governess, I cannot interfere with the operations of any of the corporations that are part of the union."

Vienne lowers her eyes. "I do not think my agent will be capable of killing in this case; I'll get an extraction team to remove the researcher."

She nods.  Her blond curls bounce playfully around her face. "Great.  Until next time." She snaps around to face the door. "Let's get this sorted by next week." And she walks out the door.

"Fuck." Vienne's voice barely audible over the sound of the door sliding shut.

# Dominic

Dominic enters yet another lab in the biotech wing of Nakitashi, it looks like every other lab, but he knows this one better than even his own.  "Maximilian Bosko, Senior Neurotechnologist, Impulse Control" is lit up on the side of the door, glowing in a pale blue light that etch around the letters.  Max is not there, so Dominic punches in the access codes, and the door slides quietly open.  He places a small silver wedge on the floor, a new proximity sensor that he designed last week.

Dominic slips through, palming the door closed behind him, a low gloom engulfs the room as the unfiltered light from outside slides out of view.  With hurried steps, the walks over the terminal, gloves appearing from his pocket and sliding onto his hands.  The terminal comes alive as he places his hands near the keyboard. A login prompt stares back at him.

A litany of common passwords blink across the screen, each one shaking an incorrect indicator at him.  A brief moment passes, and then he keys in 20541026 and presses enter.  A giant smiley face appears on the screen, and then fades away to reveal Max's workspace. *The day we met* He chews on the inside of his lower lip while opening up Max's notebook.

The entry for today:

*Project Unicorn is my greatest success and my greatest failure. While developing it, I wasn't thinking about the real ramifications of what this meant. It was supposed to help keep people happy, help them understand they role they are playing within the organization, but I fear I've stepped over the line.*

*I didn't think that they would use it to reprogram people's personality. The device is entirely too effective as swaying the test subjects, so much so that we've been able to convince them they are someone else entirely.*

*Luckily, I stopped one experiment.  Jerome went a little too far with one of the test subjects.  Had I not stepped in, they might have ended up married.  Jerome is a little desperate at the moment, but that doesn't excuse his behavior.  I've asked to have him transferred off of the project.*

*I do not know what I'm going to do.  My conscious is eating at me, and I can't talk to Dominic about it because of the security clearance for this project.  I wish they would just assign him to the project, so I wouldn't have to keep all of this from him.*

He stops reading.  A vibration in his arm means that someone has tripped the proximity sensor.  He quickly locks the terminal, removes his gloves, and sits down, thumbing his holoprojector on, his news feed flashes into view as the door slides open.

"Ji?"  Her silhouette partially blocks the light streaming in from the hallway.

"Dominic? What are you doing here?"

"I was going to ask you the same thing!"

"Max asked me to stop into the lab.  He thinks he forgot his backpack."

"And he gave you his access code for that?"

"Yeah? He gave me the temporary guest one for the day."  Dominic narrows his eyes, her face still full of shadows, a stark contrast from the bright light of the hallway.   "What are you doing here?"

"Oh. Um. I."  Dominic rubs the back of his neck. "I was going to surprise him with a midday… you know."  He brings his hand up to his mouth in an obscene gesture.  "We haven't really had much… alone… time lately."  He shrugs. "Need to fit it in where we can."

Ji's face flushes with blood, shifting from one foot to another as she walks into the lab and palms the door closed.  "Right here in the lab?  Man, that's hot."  Dominic chuckles deep from within his belly.

"Except he's not here."

# Ji
The door slides closed behind Dominic, and Ji is left in the darkness of the lab.  Her eyes search the corners of the room as she sighs, and plops down onto the green sofa, a color reminiscent of the pale green of baby food that's been left out too long.  On the white board behind it, in hurried, sprawling script "Thinking chair" with a swoop of an arrow pointing at the chair.

A long, slow exhale trails out of her mouth as she shifts her weight, continuing to look around. *Fuck this is going to be boring waiting for him*  Her eyes dart left, and dart right, head lagging behind by a brief moment.  She leans forward, leans back, shifts her weight again.

"Fuck this." she says aloud, and stands up, leaving the lab.  Down the hall, she strides, the stomp heavy feet rebounding off the walls. She pulls her wrist up to her face, and dances her fingers across the surface. *Now I'll get a notice every time Max swipes his access badge or uses his access codes*

She slips off into a side corridor, approaching a door that is marked "Janitor".  She puts her eye up to the door, even with a smudge on the otherwise clean white door.  Light illuminates her eye, a bright magenta line burst across her eye, and a quiet chime, soft and random like a wind chime precedes the door sliding open on air tracks, smooth, efficient, silent.

She slips in, and the door slides closed behind her, the shift of the air pressure the only noticeable marker.  The security office is expansive.  Endless rows of monitors line either side of the room, the vanishing point fades into darkness at the far end of the room.  The room is mostly empty.  A few terminals on the far end are manned, security interns, all young, hunch over the terminals, typing furiously, the clack of their keyboards create a soft cacophony in the room.  Claire sits at the first terminal inside of the room on the left side.  Her feet swing in counter balance with each other, and she is watching one of the feeds from the dorms.  Her loose curls of red hair bounce as her legs swing.  She notices Ji enter, and smiles.

"Hi, Ji!"

"Hello, Claire.  Whatcha watching?" She pulls up a chair and sits down next to Claire.

"Dorm feed, it's pretty boring.  Saw you getting your morning coffee."

"Did you see Dominic and his inability to wear clothes?"

"I saw the blurry smudge that the software always renders for him not wearing clothes in the halls."

"Such a shame."

"Not really.  Women are better. In. Every. Way." She arches an eyebrow, giving a crooked smile.  A hearty chuckle erupts from Ji.

"And don't you forget it."  Across all of the terminals in the security room, an alert pops up, accompanied by a slight vibration in Ji's wrist.  The alert reads "Maximilian Bosko has scanned his ID badge in Elevator #1-A-1."

"Huh, I guess I made it a security broadcast, not just to my comm unit.  Can you clean that up for me Claire?  I need to run and catch Max before he gets sucked into his research again.

Claire nods as Ji runs out the door.

# Levi

The whir of an ancient printer spins to life, spitting out sheets of dead trees with a black powder melted onto it using lasers.  The powder spells out words.  Levi likes ancient technology, the unconnected, bastions of the old world, the old nation, from the time before when the illusion of for the people by the people still existed. This ever present connected life is a vile thing to him.

Levi and his printer are housed in a small cabin in a no-man's land between his once beloved New Cascadia and the desert that stretches to the East.  The rough-hewn planks that line the walls bare the marks of a hand axe, sloppily applied, the random cuts show the frustration over time, a beautiful testament to why no one builds their own homes anymore.  The room is sparsely furnished, a small military cot sits in one corner and there is an old door sitting on top of some legs salvaged from a diner as a makeshift desk on which the printer sits along with a slender silver rectangle, hinged and open displaying a black screen with a single hash sign in white at the bottom.

The paper is gliding out of the printer, cascading gracefully to the floor.  He snatches the last page out of the air.  *Another work order* He scans the page for the most important piece of information.  "$5b UCSA credits" is printed at the bottom of the page in large, heavy type.  Knees bending with heavy, echoing cracks, he bends to shuffle the rest of the pages off of the floor.

He nods slowly.  *Some bio-nerd at Nakitashi, capture or kill, double money for capture than kill.*  He reads over the intel about position, current habits. *This guy doesn't go anywhere other than work and the dorms.*  "Hmmmm" breaks the silence.  "Elysium."

# Dominic

Elysium is in full swing when Dominic arrives, quickly slipping through the security, he is a seasoned pro now, the dance, the ritual plays out silently, magenta caressing his retinas.

Max is there, standing at the bar, hand gently around the bronzed hip of the aerialist, standing dangerously close together, naked flesh pressed against Max's clothes.  Dominic swallows hard, hand trembling, and begins to walk in their direction.  His eyes locked on Max.  *Why am I bothered by this?  Max is just a mark.*  His heart pounds louder than the music, his breathing ragged.

Max's eyes train onto Dominic, his hand retracts, and blood rushes to his face.  

"Nic? What are you doing here?"

"Me?"

"Felix was just explaining his training regime.  He said anyone can learn how, and he'd be willing to teach me."

"Yes" his voice thick with a Barcelonian accent, "it's quite easy, once you have the strength."  Pointing his long manicured fingers at Dominic, "You look like you have the strength already."

Dominic cocks an eyebrow, tilting his head.  Felix is covered in microlights pulsing to the beat of the music.  Dominic is having trouble looking at him.  "I would think endurance would be required more than strength?"

"I do have plenty of endurance too" Felix inches closer to Dominic, closing the triangle. "I usually go all night."

Dominic narrows his eyes and looks over at Max and then returns to Felix and a smile spreads across his face.

An older man, built like a tank, pushes his way passed Max, knocking him into Felix, who catches him with deft hands.  All eyes are on the man, muscles tight, bulging out of his shirt. He smell coming off of the him wrinkles all of their noses.  "Out of my way, I need a drink," he barks at them.

All three retreat, Max rubbing his arm, a little dab of blood smears onto his fingers. "The fucker cut me or something."

"How about we go back to your place and get that cleaned up?"  Felix takes their hands, and leads them out of the club.

# Max

Max keys in the code to his lab.  His disheveled hair wiggles at the air pressure difference as the lab door swings open.  His steps are slow and shuffling, his head hangs low.  Last night was wild, but this morning is rough.  His head pounds.  Not looking up, he palms the door closed. "Lights, 25% please" his voice ragged with exhaustion.

He jumps at the sound, "Hi Max."  Looking up, his eyes lock on Ji's short cropped hair, and then her eyes. 

"Hi Ji, what are you doing here?"

"I heard some rumors about your newest project."

"Clearance, Ji, I can't talk about it.  How did you get in here?"

She walks over to a terminal and types in a couple of commands on the terminal.  Her clearance record comes up on the screen.  "I have higher clearance than you.  I'm part of Nakitashi Corps security force, and you are in danger."

"What?  How is that possible?"

"I've been working on infiltrating NewTek's espionage division for quite some time.  They have me spying on Nic.  I'm not even sure why, nothing he is working on is worth stealing."

"Nic is under surveillance from NewTek?"

"Yes, and I caught him sneaking in here.  I don't know what he was planning, but something is happening, and I'm not sure what."

"How am I in danger?"

"NewTek is going to extract you.  They say Project Unicorn is too powerful.  I'm supposed to distract Nic so he remains unharmed and unaware."

Max collapses onto the floor, tears filling his eyes.  "I wish I had never had this fucking idea," he wails.  Ji meanders over to him, her motions tentative, searching.  She places her hand on his shoulder, squatting down to his level.  She raps him quickly across the face.

"Pull your shit together, we need to get you into protective custody.  Now!" she manhandles him, pulling him to his feet, her strength belying her size.  A gun has appeared from the aether, and she is pushing him out the door.

Max snaps out of his fugue state, wrenching his arm out of her grasp.

"No!" a force of will he is not used to mustering.  "Where is Nic?  We can't let him get caught in the cross fire."

"Goddamn it, we don't have time for this shit."  Everything goes black as the crackle of a stunpatch echoes down the hallway.

# Vienne

Vienne paces her office.  The holoprojector of Ji's bust hovers above the center table. The painting of an abstract scene of a worker rebellion seeps through the imperfect project, colors infusing Ji's figure with certain gayety, a juxtaposition not lost on Vienne.

"What do you mean Maximilian has disappeared?"

"That's what Dominic told me, he's quite worried. I don't think he's even showered in a few days."

"One moment."  She quickly disengages the holoprojector, and picks up a small receiver from her desk, pressing in the sequence "53409871049103###".  A squelching sound reverberates around her office, then static, then a voice.

"Operator Seven" a deep male voice intones.

"Seven Eight Nine, Tango, Xylophone, Alpha."

"Target has not been acquired.  Recon still happening."

She puts the device down, clicking the power button off, then reengages the holoprojector.

"… I can't, I can't get no, I can't get no …" Off-key and arrhythmically.

"Ji!"  And her holographic form starts, coming to attention. "Our extraction agent has not taken him.  You must find out what happened.  Report back once you know more."  The holographic display clicks off with a press of a button.

"Shit. Shit. Shit."  Her fingers glide over the console, and after a few seconds, Dominic's face appears on the projector.  "Status report time, Nic."

"I thought the extract wasn't scheduled for a few days.  I didn't have time to get the research, and now that Max is gone, I don't know what i'm supposed to do about the research."  His eyes are bloodshot, his hair a scattered mess of red and black strands.

"Calm down, Dominic.  We have not taken him."

"What?" his eyes go wild. "Where is he then? Who took him? Is there another agency that knew about the project and beat us to the jump?"

"Highly unlikely.  Dominic, this project was handed down to us."  A brief pause as her fingers fly across the console keyboard.  The holograph blips out and then back in.

A disembodied voice, British, Female, the artificial intelligence's idea of a trust worth, learned voice, "Encryption Protocol Engaged. All further communication is deemed top secret, priority one.  Do not disclose under penalty of death."

"This mission is coming from the Governess of the UCSA directly. No other agency is privy, unless she has lost faith in our ability to deliver, but she would have notified me."

"What if it's unsanctioned?"

"Impossible.  No corporation would be that suicidal." doubt begins to creep into her brain, but she brushes it away.

"What about–"

"–Those are folklore, Dominic.  We, " emphasis, " are the black ops."

"Right…"

"Dominic, just relax. I have at least one agent on this. Your current action items are to remain calm, downplay his disappearance, convince people that he is just on a vacation.  Dead aunt, maybe?"

Dominic rubs his eyes with the heel of his hands, running his hands through his hair.  "Okay.  I'll try."

"There is an ancient proverb, 'Do or do not, there is no try.' Just remember that."

He nods his head, and the screen blips off.

# Levi

There are times when Levi will admit new technology is worth a damn. This is one of those times.  A small red dot hovers above a paper map laid out on the large wooden table in his embassy suite, much too posh for the likes of him, paid for by NewTek International Holdings.  High power clients come with perks.

His muddy boots are propped up on the artisan surface of the table, smearing what smells like shit onto the edge of the table.  He remains placid, intently watching the dot.  It is moving rapidly. *must be in a car, where is he going?*

The red dot is a projection from the holoprojector.  A geotrack receiver is communication with airborne drones that hover the city, relaying signals in a mesh.  The drones are part of a Nakitashi-led research project to develop self-healing packet relay networks that are unbound by the earth.  They indiscriminately transfer packets between them, routing seamlessly from source to destination through a trillion microdecisions.  The employees call it "the brain of Nakitashi-san".  There is more than a little hint of ridicule in the name, but it serves its purpose.

And in Levi's case, it's routing the positioning signal from the geotrack embedded device he injected into his extraction target.  He is glad that he suffered through Elysian to get this device into his target.  The target had gone dark for a full day, did not return home, did not go to work, did not visit his fuck-buddy in Elysian.  No trace by conventional means.

The holoprojector pops up a small floating box with "Incoming…" written in it.  "Encryption enabled, please state response to challenge A5DE02F" appears, letter by letter.

Slow and methodical fingers tap in the response code "æbleskiver kiesershmarrn crêpe pancake".  It takes him three minutes to type it in.  Vienne appears on the screen.

"About fucking time, old man."

"How can I help you, Ms. Baune?"

"What's the status of the extraction?"

"The target went dark yesterday.  I have activated the tracking device I implanted in him.  Tracking his movement now, and he appears to be in a car."

"I have reason to believe that Nakitashi is aware of the eminent extraction."

"My price triples."

"What?"  the word cuts through the air like a garrote.

"Hazard pay. It's in the contract.  Extract requires breaching security even further than originally planned.  Target has settled, according to the city blueprints, he is being held at Nakitashi Maximum Security Prison."

"So get yourself arrested."

"Negative. Too high profile.  Get me as a guard. You have those connections, I'm just muscle."

"One moment, Mr. Kane."  A third voice on the line, unfamiliar, ambiguously a woman's voice, most likely some AI.  NewTek holds the patents on some pretty impressive AI right now.  A small box pops up, a series of skeuomorphic folders appear in the holoprojector.  "Your new identity.  Please use transfer protocol alpha to install into implant,"  the AI voice chimes.

"Extract will be done before the end of the day."

# Vienne

"Nic, you look awful."  The visage of Dominic on the screen is a haggard mess of an unshaven jaw, deep lines etching under his eyes.  He vibrates from an unseen leg, shaking, as he sucks in on a nicostick.  "You don't smoke."

"Now's just as good of a time as any.  What do you want?"

"Nic, are you losing it?  Do we need to have an intervention."

"My subject is gone.  This has never happened to me."

"Maybe it's for the better.  I'm going to recommend that we pull you okay."

"No!" his eyes go wild in the holoprojector, a flash of calm morphs his face into a placid mask.  "I've got this.  I have a plan.  I will reacquire Max if he's in the city still."

"And what if he's gone?  What if something spooked him and he fled?"

"He wouldn't do that without me.  We would be going together.  He loves me.  Not that you would understand."

"Nic, this isn't the time."

"Fuck you, Vienne, you don't know anything about love."

"Have you been turned?  Are you in love with him now?"

"Five years, you frigid bitch."

"Answer the question, you fucking man-child!" she snaps at him.

"No! Yes? Fuck I don't know anymore."

"The leaders were afraid this might happen.  Five years is too long, but we had faith in you.  Did you destroy the plans and all the data?"

He shakes his head erratically.

"Is that a yes?"

"Affirmative.  You want a robot, right?  Affirmative Human Female. The plans have been destroyed per your goddamn, fucking orders."

"And no other copies exist?"

He holds up a small cylinder with a glowing red socket on it.  "All except this one."

"And you will deliver it at the dead drop tomorrow night?"

"This one?  Not quite yet."

"Dominic Quinn! This is not a game.  If you don't deliver that drive to the drop point…"

"What?  What will happen?  Remote termination?  You don't think I know your tricks?  I disabled that on day one, dug it out of my arm with a fucking pen knife."

"Nic, sweetheart, you are putting me in a real bind here."

"Good."  And Dominic's projection disappears.

"Motherfucker!" A glass vase smashes into the safety glass of the windows, bouncing off and cascading into a million pieces on the floor, the single daisy splaying out across the ground, the delicate circuits of the artificial flower snap and spark as it hits the ground, cracking.

Simon appears in the doorway.  "Ms. Baune?  The leaders are requesting your presence in the board room.  They were monitoring that exchange.

***

Vienne returns to her office, head hanging low, feet shuffling forward.  Her weight heavy as she falls back into her chair.  "Simon!"

Simon appears in the doorway again.  "Termination Order.  Dominic Quinn.  Go through the list of agents, pick the one with the worst track record."

"Madame?"

"Worst track record.  He deserves that much. A little fighting chance."

"Are you going to warn him?"

"They didn't order me not to, and take your time, no rush.  And bring me a gin and tonic, please."

"Yes, Madame."  He leaves her alone to her thoughts.  *Damn it, Nic. You forced their hand.  Going rogue*  She slumps forward, forehead hitting the desk.  "I hope you know what you are doing, Nic."

She types in a secure message, encrypting with her personal key, hoping Dominic still has it.  "Term Ord Eff Imdy Sry <3".

She raises her head from the desk.  A glass of gin and tonic sits on the corner.  *Such a silent kid*

# Ji

*fuck fuck fuck* Two guards in crisp black uniforms, with short, cylindrical caps, and the Nakitashi Security Force logo, a stylized shield with a snake on it, in black ink, on their breast pockets.  Between them, they carry a gurney, Max sprawled out, arms dangling, legs slightly akimbo.

They carry him into an isolation cell, Ji following closely behind, watching the medical read out.  Max's pulse is weak but stable.  The guards assist in moving Max onto the isolation cell's closed-cell foam block that serves as a bed.  Max's weight sinks into the foam, supporting him effortlessly.

All three exit the cell and Ji presses her wrist to the control panel.  A small vibration sends a pleasant shockwave down her arm, and the door slides closed with a hiss, sealing in place.

The guards take up a position on either side of the room.  "No one is allowed to interact with his prisoner.  Understood?  His identity, crime, and term of incarceration are clearance level zero."

In unison, "Yes, sir!"  One of the guards looks at the other guard, "um, I mean, ma'am."

Ji shakes her head, and walks towards the exit.  She turns back in time to see the guard hit the other one lightly on the shoulder and whisper to themselves.

*fuck fuck fuck*  She enters the main security office of the prison.  The three guards who are sitting at monitors jump to their feet and salute.  She waves them to sit down.  "I'm not military."

"But you are corporate security, so you out rank us." A fresh-faced guard speaks up, the scraggly ends of platinum blond hair shoot out from under his cap.  He has a round baby face, with cheeks Ji wants to pinch. 

"What's your name?"

"Cadet Johnson, ma'am!"

"Everyone is sir here, cadet."

"Sorry, sir."

"How long have you been working here?"

"Two months, sir."

She exhales sharply. "Give it time."

# Dominic

He holds a monofilament wire in his hand.  An adjustable loop droops down to the floor, the weight barely registering on the wire as it flutters in the wind.  The roof of the dorm is 115 stories up, and the wind is fierce, but he has no choice.  Max is gone, and something must be done to find him.

He steps close to the edge, the wind to his back, urging him closer and closer to the ledge.  One false step, and he will plummet to his death.  His target, one of the pieces of the brain hovering ten feet away, suspended in the sky by a series of whirling blades.

He takes a second piece of monofilament from the ground.  It's been anchored to a pipe that extends from the rooftop.  He ties it around his waist, ensuring there is no slack in the line.  He steadies his feet, bending his knees.  *Ten feet, You can do this*  He tosses the loop into the air, the wind catching it, pulling it further out from the building, but the eddy currents from the propellers divert it off course and away from the drone.

He breaths in deeply and slowly lets it out.  He pulls in monofilament, readying himself again.  This toss is too high, the loop catching the wind and overshooting the drone.  It begins the fall, fifteen feet out, as it reaches the level of the drone, the wind shifts slightly, blowing the filament right into one of the propellers.  The drone is coming in fast, winding the filament onto the rotor.  Dominic ducks out of the way, but one of the propellers catch him in the arm, opening a small gash on his deltoid, pain searing him as the drone falls to the ground.

It thrashes on the ground for a few seconds before the onboard computer registers that it has crash, and shuts off power to the motors.  He quickly reaches down, and pulls the battery before the distress signal can engage.  *Now it will just register as a power failure*

He steps away from the ledge, heading towards the service hatch.

…

The drone is splayed out in pieces on the bed, Dominic hovering over it, a murderer carefully laying out pieces of his victim for purposes unknown.

Dominic pulls the drone service manual from the edge of the bed.  His brow furrows, as his finger traces a line across the page.  A pair of wire cutters in his hand.  He snips a red wire.

"Okay, I think this does it."  He picks up the largest circuit board, clips two alligator clips to it.  He walks over to the wall near the holoprojector.  One of the smooth panels has been removed, exposing the circuitry underneath.  He peers in.  "Ah," and he clips the alligator clips to unseen points in the wall.

The holoprojector blips on, a random, glitching pattern swelling into the room.  He rushes over to the console, his hands fly over the keyboard with grace and determination.  The mass of the projection amalgamates into discrete blips, a field of stars.  Each star is labeled with a frequency band, geodex location within the city, and the current rate of data flow.

A few more minutes, and lines begin to slide across between nodes, short lengths of line, packets within the network, the speed picks up and soon it's running at full speed, a blur of data running through the system.

Soon, the colors of the lines begin to shift.  A search protocol for any mention of Max's id runs through the system.  A green line floats up out of the mire of the traffic, thin and faint.  Dominic stares at it, types a few things on the keyboard, and the line expands into a breakdown of the packet.

```
[ stunpatch v1.5.2;
  bpm:63;
  bp: 110/62; # warning out of nominal rage
  temperature: 98;
  brain-activity: low; ]
```

"He has a stunpatch on him!"  With a knitted brow, he begins to work out the origin drone.  The projection zooms in to a single drone.  "He's in the prison?"

He rushes out of the door, sliding into the wall as he shifts direction, heading down the hallway.  A slight heaving of his chest as he reaches Ji's door.  He bangs on it, and waits.  *Right, she'll be at work still*

He sprints back down the hallway to the elevator and presses the button once.  And then again.  And then again. This pattern repeats until the elevator doors open, and he walks in.  On the way down, he punches in a request for a car.

The car is waiting when he exists the building, he squints against the harsh light of the sun, and slides into the car.  "To Nakitashi Maximum Security Prison."

The voice of the car is deep, reverberating, and final. "You are not authorized for that location."  He slides over the top of the seat into the front seat, and pulls the autodrive system out.  Grasping the wheel, he flicks the car into gear, and pushes the throttle forward.  The car lurches forward, picking up speed, pressing him hard into the seat.

Signals fly back and forth between the Nakitashi central processing and the car.  The anomaly of the autodrive system suddenly disconnecting raises a flag. The subsequent acceleration, relayed by sensors on the car, causes the AI to decide that the vehicle has been stolen.  The Nakitashi police force is dispatched with the location of the vehicle, and the remote kill switch authorization code is transmitted over the drone network to the car.

The car slams to a stop, Dominic's head bashing into the steering wheel, and he is knocked unconscious.

# Levi

The roar of his motorcycle echoes off of the valley of buildings, tearing down the street, he weaves in and out between the slow, self-driving cars.  Like everything, this bike is an antique, but in perfect repair.  Back in the '10s, the Magpul Ronin was a fabled bike, pushing the design of the motorcycle forward, a concept piece that went into production in the last '10s.  Only a small handful were made, but they were solid bikes.  He spent a year faithfully restoring this bike.  He loves it more than he loves his daughter.

Nakitashi has the autodrive systems set to slower than average speeds. He pontificated that the slow speeds are to induce a sense of tranquility into the city, a sense of not needing to rush around and be busy.  Akio Nakitashi is full of shit.

But Levi uses the slow speeds and ample spacing to zip through the streets.  The prison is an underground facility on the outskirts of Nakitashi City, stretching miles under the desert borderlands of the city.  He pulls up to a low, squat building, a polished black exterior, absorbing the light like it absorbs the criminal element of the city.

Like most prisons in the UCSA, criminal is decided by the corporation.  Anyone who works against the corporate interests of the respective corporations are subject to imprisonment for indefinite amounts of time.  The only regulation the UCSA imposes on the prison system is about the use of torture.  Physical torture is never allowed.

He pulls the bike to a stop parallel to the building in the small amount of shade the building provides.  Whipping his leg over the motorcycle, he walks over to the door, and swipes his wrist against the security sensor.  A series of beeps, the whir of unseen electric motors, and the door slides open.  The pressure differential blows through his short black hair, and he walks in.

A second door sits just within the first, enough room for two people to stand.  The outer door slides shut.  A voice echoes in the little room.

"Identify,"  the voice robotic with a hint of a British accent.

"Private Aiden Maksimov, reporting for transfer."

A brief pause and the door slides open.  A man with a face like a relief map, scored deep with age and weather stands on the other side of the door.

"A bit old for a private, arentcha?"

"Transferred from another company, must start at the bottom rungs, Sir."

"What was your previous rank?"

"General."

"Don't think you will be running the show around here, private."

"I understand the order of things, Sir.  Rank is Rank."

"Indeed.  At ease, private."

Levi spreads his legs slightly, arms behind his back.  *This is going to be a long con to get this kid out of here.*

"What company did you say you are coming from?"

"I didn't, Sir, explicit instructions to not discuss it from the extraction team, Sir."

"Come now, private, your commanding officer supersedes all other orders."

"No, Sir, NDA requires me, under microinjection implant, to not discuss this."

"Very well, private.  Follow me."

Levi is led around, given the grand tour, at the end of the tour is the large steel door leading to the isolation cells.  The yellow stenciled letters spell out "High Security Clearance Personnel Only."

"These are the isolation cells.  Reserved for the worst offenders and protective custody.  You don't have clearance to enter there, so our tour will end now.  Head back to the security center, talk to the PIC up there, and they will give you an assignment."

"Yes, Sir," Levi snaps, a quick salute, and he falls back down the corridor.  *This'll take me a few days.*

# Max

A signal from the central processing center signals the stunpatch to release its hold on Max.  Within a few minutes, his eyes flutter open.  He is inside of a cube.  The walls are smooth slate gray, with no discernible cracks in them to hint at a door.  A small ventilation grate is dead center in the roof, three meters from each wall.  He is laying on a foam mattress in one of the corners.

He cannot move his body.  The stunpatch releases the mind first, then the body slowly as the electrical restraint releases its hold on the nervous system.   The time ticks by, eyes focused on the grate in the ceiling.  An eternity passes with the grate as his only companion, the sound of air trickling in from the grate the only song his ears know.

His fingers twitch, and then his arm moves.  He pushes himself up.  The cube is gray on gray. The mattress is gray, the cold aluminum of the toilet and sink along the wall his head now rests is gray.  The absence of color is nothing new with Nakitashi.

He needs to urinate.  He tries to move his legs, but they are still in the confines of the stunpatch.  His hands search, trying to find the bastardly little device that Ji slapped on him.  He finds it on the back of his leg, behind his knee, and yanks it off.  His legs suddenly work.

Standing up, legs trembling beneath him, he makes his way to the toilet, unbuttons, and let's loose a torrent of urine into the toilet.  A sigh escapes his lips, and he's done.

He looks around at his confinement.  *If the toilet is facing this way* he turns around the commode. *Then this is the portal*  He presses his face near the wall opposite the toilet, peering into the gray.

"I know you are out there."  He knocks on the wall.  The gray shimmers slightly when he touches it.  "I demand to see Ji Go."  The wall sparks slightly, knocking him back to the ground.  He slaps the cold gray stone. "Fuck!"

# Dominic

The flash of red and blue lights pound into Dominic's eyes rousing him from his unconscious state.  With his eyes now open, he can tell there are three varying patterns, interweaving their own blue and red lights.

His hands are roughly pinioned behind his back, a small strip of steel plastic encircle his wrists.  He can hear the hoarse voice of a woman speaking. "Dominic Quinn, midlevel engineer, cohabitating with Maximilian Bosko for the last four years." A radio voice, indiscernibly words buzzing out of the radio. "CPC says the car denied taking him to the prison. Found autodrive system ripped out. We assume he was attempting to self-drive to the prison." More buzzing from the radio. "He is not licenses for vehicle control."

A second voice with youthful exuberance pipes up. "Ma'am, he's awake."

"Dispatch, please hold."

The woman appears in front of Dominic, at the end of the squad car where he is slung.  She is middle aged with laugh lines heavily creasing the sides of her face.  Her stringy brown hair spills out of her patrol cap as she takes it off and squats down to get to his level.  Her knees pop loudly as she sinks down.  Her nameplate reads "Bahr".

"What were you thinking?"

"My boyfriend was taken to prison, I was trying to go find out what happened to him."

"Why didn't you go through proper channels.  There are procedures.  You know this.  Your record shows that you helped implement the current system."

Tears stream down from Dominic's eyes.

"I'm just so worried about him."

The radio buzzes.  The young officer comes over and whispers something into the woman's ear.  Dominic gets a good look at him.  Blond, Fit, bright shining blue eyes, but he looks distinctly Japanese, a contrast to his aryan coloring.   His nameplate labels him "Jones".

The woman's face turns stone cold. "How did you break the security clearance surrounding Max's arrest?  You do not have the clearance."

"I was worried about him."  She strikes him hard against the face.

"How did you know he was arrested?"

"I have friends."  She strikes him again.

"How did you find out he was arrested?"  her voice demanding, carrying a lethal edge of warning.

"I hacked the drone network, bitch, stunpatch packets, pretty easy given the lack of drones out by the prison."  She delivers a heavy blow to his face, closed fist this time.  She picks him up off the back of the squad car, roughly tossing him into the back, and closes the door.

She gets into the passenger seat, and Officer Jones gets into what used to be the driver seat.  

"Well, Mr. Quinn, your desire to see the inside of the prison just might be granted today.  Central Processing," she barks to the autodrive system and the car lurches forward.  "But first, booking."

***

She pulls him to his feet, hauling him out of the squad car.  Central Processing is a spire of a building, slender and impossibly tall.  The top ten floors are offices and the rest of the building is dedicated to the arrays of processors that run Nakitashi's core AI, the system that keeps the city running.

The enormous amounts of heat generated by the processors is dissipated by the paper thin metal fins that cover the top half of the spire.  The spire is open to the wind that sweeps passed in all directions, whisking the heat away from the processing units.  They are mounted on flexible rods, tensions against each other to remain vertical, but flexible to sway and rock in the wind.  The tower takes on the visage of a tentacle during wind storms.

This is the critical point of failure for Nakitashi City, so a reinforced steel lattice structure, large enough to avoid collision during high winds, sheaths the building like an ill-fitting, rigid condom.

The building entrance is a set of large wood and bronze doors rescued from destruction during the New York uprising of 2020 by Nakitashi's father, then magistrate of the former New England states.  They are now held territories of the UCSA, and form the core of its power.

The doors are retrofitted with hydraulic actuators that cause them to swing open as they approach.  Central booking for Nakitashi is housed in the first floor.  He is led with aggressive hands to the first room to the right of the door.  The plastic handcuffs are removed after the door locks behind them.

"Remove your clothing."  Officer Bahr tells him, with a slight upward tick of her chin.

"What?" his brow knits.

"All personal items are removed as part of booking, clothing included.  Now strip, or I will have Officer Jones do it for you."

Heavy breath in and out, and he kicks off his shoes, beginning to unbutton his shirt.  Officer Bahr licks her lips, and Dominic turns away, now staring at Officer Jones who is sorting through forms to find the appropriate paperwork.

Shirt, socks, pants, all fall to the floor.  "Underwear too."  Using his left hand to do his best to cover himself, he slips his underwear to the ground.  Officer Jones eyes dart back to his paperwork.  "Over there for the pictures."

"Pictures?  How is this in line with company policy?"

"It's just mugshots, shut up and go over there, face the far wall."  She points to the white and black striped wall.  Pop of the flash.  "Now face the camera".  Dominic turns.  Pop. "Biometrics scan time.  Eye to that sensor." She points at a round glass sphere on the wall.  It is low, requiring him to bend over slightly.

"Hold out both arms, straight in front of you."  Dominic complies with a roll of his eyes.  "Which hand is your interface sensor in?" She roughly rotates his wrists around.  "Jones, mark down that his interface is in the left wrist."

She takes out two small metal bracelets, dark metal with a matte finish and a small, blinking red light at one end of the open clasp.  She places one on each wrist, closing the clasp.  The red light goes solid, and then changes to magenta.

"These are active restraint systems.  They stop the use of your interface, and allow us to attach you to any appropriate surface in the prison system.  Like so"  She takes his left arm, and presses it against the wall.  Magenta becomes green, and the bracelet fuses with the wall, immovable.  She swipes her wrist against them and they come free.

"If you behave and follow orders, we will not need to use these.  If you don't, you might find yourself hanging from your hands.  Understood?"

Dominic nods, goosebumps spread across his naked flesh.  Officer Jones reappears with a white jumpsuit, handing it to Dominic.  "Put this on," his voice tentative, soft.  Officer Jones casts his eyes down and then quickly pops his eyes back up, flushing his face with blood.  He turns around and goes back to his paperwork.  Dominic smirks, slipping into the white jumpsuit.  As long as it does not get wet, it's a small step above being completely naked.

"Jones, take him to the holding area."

"Yes, Ma'am"

Jones stands behind Dominic and pushes him slight forward.  The door in the far side of the room clicks open, and they push through.  The hallway is lined with a mural depicting the suppressing of the workers rebellion from five years ago.  Police in riot gear, protestors in white masks facing off in Central Park, the background a mist of tear gas.  The protestors carry guns, cudgels, and bottles are being hurtled at the police.  *Propaganda!*

The hallway is empty, and Jones is not in a hurry, his hand lightly pressing into Dominic's back.  "Do you have a boyfriend?"  a smirk crawling across Dominic's face.

Officer Jones blushes again. "No, not right now."

"I think I've seen you at Elysian."

"Maybe."

"I'll buy you a drink once I get out of here."

"Are you trying to bribe me?"

Dominic shakes his head, "You have it wrong.  I don't need to bribe you."  The bracelets click off of his wrists and hit the ground.  His hands are on Officer Jones' mouth is a flash.  He pushes Jones into the bathroom to their right, locking the door behind them.

"You do not know who you are dealing with.  I'm going to pull out the stunpatch on your belt, and attach it to you.  It's going to hurt.  It's going to suck, and I'm sorry for this necessity, but first."  Dominic grabs Officer Jones' wrist, and pushes it against his own.  The indicator screens on both of their wrists flash violently for a brief moment.  His hands run along Jones' hips, searching for the stunpatch while keeping their eyes locked together.  The stunpatch activates as it presses into Jones' neck.

Dominic drags him into the nearby stall and removes his clothes, slipping out of his jumpsuit, and putting on Jones' uniform.  Jones' chest was slimmer that Dominic's, and the buttons strain against the button hole, limiting his arm movements.  He slips Jones into the jumpsuit, closing the stall door behind him.

He slips out of the bathroom, and puts on the patrol cap, looking back down the hall, and then forward.  *I'll have to erase the biometric scan, but for now, must get out of here and get to the prison.*

# Ji

Ji is sleeping with her head lolling back, drool coming out of one side of her mouth, a deep, grumbly breath draws in and out of her mouth.  Cadet Johnson, turns his head to stare at her when she snorts awake.

Wiping the drool from her mouth, she sits up, "Sorry, I haven't had much sleep lately."

"No problem, sir."

"Anything to report?"

"There was a hit for the employee you asked to monitor."

"D Quinn?"

"Yes, sir, he was arrested for autodrive jacking."

"He was jerking off in an autodrive car?"

"No, ma'am, er, sir, he stole a car."

"Fuck the fuck?"

"Yes sir"  He pulls up the full body mug shot on the computer screen.  "I thought we weren't supposed to take these anymore?"

"At the discretion of the arresting officer.  Who was it?  Oh, Joanna Bahr.  She's a fucking bear.  You ever meet her?"

"No, sir."

"Probably for the best. Any other details?"

"No, sir.  It says he is currently in the holding pen awaiting judgement."

"Okay, Pluto, security override Delta, Indigo, Cappa, Cappa.  This is agent Ji Go, drop all charges from Dominic Quinn, erase biometric scan, and release."

"Sir, why would you do that to a jacker?"

"You really need to use different phrasing, son.  He's a good guy, I know why he was trying to steal the car.  It's not his fault."

"Sir?"

"Someone close to him has disappeared, he's panicking.  What would you do?"

"Proper channels, sir."

"Dominic isn't a proper channels kind of guy." A small vibration on her wrist causes her to look down.  "If you'll excuse me." She stands and walk towards the door, exiting into the hallway.  Her steps quicken in cadence.  She ducks into the bathroom.  Bending down, no feet, she locks the door.  Far end of the room, she calls up the viewscreen for her implant.  Vienne's face appears.

"Ji, thank god."

"What's the emergency, boss-lady?"

"It's Dominic."

"Yeah I know, he was arrested, I took care of it."

"There is more to it than you know.  Dominic is one of our agents."

"Really?  Is Max too?"

"No, Max was the mark.  Dominic's way in."

"Oh that makes sense.  So Dominic's really straight then?"

"What?  Why does that matter right now? Dominic is in danger."

"Danger?"

"The leaders have decided to terminate her contract."

"Oh fuck.  I should have left him in jail."

"He wasn't in jail, he escaped.  Stole some officer's uniform, access codes." the holoprojected image of Vienne shakes her head.  "It's bad."

"Why? I mean, the guy's pretty and all but he knew the risks."

"Ji, Nic and I have a history.  It is over now, but a history."

"I knew he couldn't be a cocksucker for real!"

"Ji! Focus!"

"Yeah yeah, Do you want me to find him, secure him, and then get him out of here?"

"I'm not sure what to do.  He will need to become corporation-less, live in the outlands, I'd guess."

"It's okay, Vienne, Nakitashi can give him sanctuary."

"He would have to admit he's an agent of NewTek."

"You already admitted it."

"What?"

"Oh, I'm just your run of the mill double agent, freedom fighter."

"Oh god."

"I have enough evidence to take NewTek down now.  Trying to steal a mind control device.  Deep cover operatives, using sex to infiltrate research teams, stealing tech.  I've got it all, baby.  And I'm going to take them down."

"Ji, they'll kill me."

"Maybe, maybe not.  That extraction agent you contacted?  Maybe change his contract, extract yourself."

"I would be ruined."

"Not my problem, Ms. Baune.  Not my problem,"  and she shuts off the viewscreen.  She unleashes a primal scream, guttural, concussive. "oh yeah! that felt good."  She struts out of the bathroom.  A few officers are milling about in the hallway and stare at her when she exits.

"Had a great dump."  She points back at the bathroom, and nods.

Back in the control room, she barks, "Pluto, APB Dominic Quinn, security concern, apprehend immediately, and into isolation chamber."

The robotic voice responds, "Acknowledged."

Cadet Johnson is still sitting at his terminal.  "Sir?  Something changed?"

"High clearance something, sorry, kid."

# Vienne

"Levi?"  her voice shaky, tentative.  Her arms mirror the shake of her voice, one arm crossing her chest, the other, holding a nicostick near her mouth.

A robotic voice responds, "Your party is currently occupied, please leave a message, and it will be relayed in text."

"Levi, change of contract, extraction target now Ms. Vienne Baune plus one for extraction to Nakitashi from NewTek.  Please confirm receipt."

Her home is a small estate along the water in Silicon Valley.  She always found it strange they continue to call it this even after "The Fall".  It's now home to NewTek International Holdings, Ltd.  Her house is a company house, designed to look like an antebellum planation house.  Some tech millionaire originally built it, romanticizing the "old south".  He was single, had started a number of companies that NewTek eventually bought or stole.

The estate lawn is maintained by a set of small robots that swarm the grounds every morning, weeding, watering, and trimming the plant life to keep it perfect.  This is required for all company-owned homes.

The inside of the house has been retrofitted with all of the latest technology.  She barely needs to touch anything during the course of her day.  She stands, pacing in her kitchen.  Her face etched deep with worry.

There is a bang outside, and she jumps out of her skin, letting out a small yelp.  "It was just an animal, Vienne, pull it together,"  she says to herself.

Simon enters from the hallway, a towel wrapped around his waist.  His chest is defined with a light dusting of dark hair across it.  "Everything okay, Madame?"

"Are you coming with me, Simon?"

"I don't see that I have any other choice."

"I'm sorry you are part of this."

He moves in to close the distance between them.  He puts his hands on her shoulders, presses his body against her. "I love you. Why wouldn't I be a part of this?"  He turns his head to the side and rests it on her chest.  Sometimes she forgets how tall she is.

"Simon, you don't know what love is."

He shrugs, "I feel something for you.  Maybe it's love, maybe it's a fierce feeling of loyalty, but does it matter?"  He presses his lips into her neck, biting softly.

She pushes him away slightly.  "Simon, don't."

"I should put on clothes."  He turns around to leave, but she grabs the edge of his towel, pulling it off of him as he walks away, his butt oscillating contraction and relaxation as he continues to walk out the room.

# Levi

Levi is on his third day at the prison.  He has proven himself to be a capable, rule-regarding private, and the general is quite favorable of him.  He is eating lunch with the one of guards from the isolation cells, Officer Jameson.  he looks frail, his skin a pallid gray with long dark hair.  He speaks with an accent that Levi cannot place, from somewhere in the baltic states.  *All these kids working here*

"And you restored the motorcycle yourself?"

"Yes, Sir, every inch of her."

"What's it like to ride it?  Would you mind if I tried it?"

"Do you know how to ride a cycle?"

"Not really.  But I'm sure I'm a fast learner."

"Sure, let's go out to the desert, no cars around here, and I can teach you."

"Rad!"  Officer Jameson pumps his arms into the air.

"How about tonight after your shift is over?"  Levi leans in.

"Sure, I get off at 6," the smile make the words bright and energetic.

"Perfect."

***

Jameson's arms are held tight against Levi's waist as they speed down the road, the monotonous landscape of desert blurring as they sail through the evening air.  After an hour, Levi pulls off onto the side of the road, stopping the bike in a flourish of dust, swirling around them against the last evening sun.

"Why'd we come so far out?"

"So there is no signal. No Witnesses."

"What do you mean?" a tremble to his words, his eyebrows raise.

"No signal means no cars, no cars mean no people."

"Oh okay, so no one to report me for driving unlicensed?"  His voice relaxes.

"Right." Levi is deadpan.  "Hop on," he ticks his head towards the bike.

With a spring to his step, Jameson hops back onto the bike.  "How do I start it?"

"Hold down on that right there, now press down hard with your foot."  The engine roars to life, some crows fly into the air, startled by the sudden sound.  The vibration is added to Jameson's voice.

"Now what?" his words stretch out to the horizon.  Levi is behind him, body pressed against his, crook of the elbow pressing into Jameson's throat.  Arms flailing, grasping for air, grasping for release.  The moment lingers, hands pleading, clawing, slapping in vain.  Legs straighten, trying to dislodge.  Spasm, and then limp.

"Sorry, Kid."  He picks up Jameson's wrist, his hand flops around.  A small box connects between them, with a series of beeps and then "Transfer Complete" flashes across the screen of the box.

Levi pushes Jameson's rag doll body off of the motorcycle, landing face first in the dirt, knees buckled under him.

Levi shakes his head.  "Fuck, kid. I can't leave you like this.  You'll die."

He hauls Jameson up onto the back of the bike, lashing him down to the back.  "Hmm" he rubs his chin.  "Nah that won't work."  He stares off into the distance for a moment before hanging his head.

He opens the seat compartment rummaging around in it, pulling out a small vial.  He cracks it open, and waves it under Jameson's nose.  Jameson jolts, eyes snapping open.

"What? What happened?" confusion grips his voice.

"I don't know, man, you started to choke or something, fell over, passed out.  Good thing I had these smelling salts."

He stares up into the sky, and brings his eyes to meet Levi's.  "You, you tried to strangle me?"

Levi laughs, "What?  Nonsense.  Why would I do that?"

"I don't know."

"I think something might have stung you, little bit of venom.  It can cause weird shit to happen.  Desert is full of those things, man."

Levi extends a hand to help Jameson off the ground.  Standing Jameson dusts himself off, wiping the dust from his face.  "Whatever, take me home."

"Sure thing, you might want to get your head looks at, you took a pretty nasty spill when you passed out."

"Yeah."  He hops onto the bike behind Levi, grabbing tightly around his waist again.

# Dominic

The voice squawks over the comm system. "APB Dominic Quinn," his picture flashes across the heads up display in the bottom half of the window. "Considered Armed and Dangerous. Non-lethal force authorized. Section 10 capture and detain."

The squad car is equipped with a wide array of fun toys, and Dominic is pleased the autodrive system is functioning.  He they manage to track the access codes, it will shutdown, and then he'll be in trouble, but for now, he is looking over the gear.

Direct siege is not his speciality, but high-powered laser knife for cutting through doors and seat belts takes up a place on his makeshift weapon sling.  A weaponized stunpatch gun is also added, this one rigged to be close to his hand for immediate draw.

The radio chimes in, "Update on Dominic Quinn, Stolen ID from Officer Eliot Jones, central processing search for usages."

"Fuck."  He kicks the autodrive system out of gear, and takes control of the wheel.  His foot slams down on the accelerator, pushing him deep against the seat, as he swerves to avoid the slow moving autodriven cars in front of him.  He flips on the sirens.  A radio signal radiates out to the autodrive cars, and a space opens up.  He slips through them like a thief in the night, smooth, silent, and efficient.

His speed tops out, and he settles back, the cars parting with enough time, adjusting to his speed, never being an impedance, until he needs to make a turn.  He slams on his brakes, waiting for the autodrive cars to make room, and as he turns sharply down Dexter, the engine cuts off, and the door locks engage.

"All patrols within the vicinity of Dexter and Denny, suspect at large, Dominic Quinn has been detained in patrol car twelve west.  Be advised, suspect should be considered armed and dangerous.  Engage remote control system to transfer to prison."

"Fuck!" his hands slam into the steering wheel.  He looks around, searching for something, noticing the SlamBar, designed to break safety glass in the case of auto collision.  It's a vestigial piece of equipment that predates the autodrive system.  Since it was invented, collisions are almost non-existent.

He primes the charge, and places the flat bar against the windshield.  He presses the small metal button on the top of the bar, squeezing his face against his expectations.  The charge ignites, and the windshield presses out, rebounds back in, pushing his arm into his body, and then wobbles back into place.  Small fractures appear in the windshield, but the Duraflex safety glass withheld the force.

*Goddamn it*  He kicks hard with the heel of his shoe, and a large crack sounds, suddenly swallowed by the wailing of the sirens.  Two patrol cars, slide into view on either side of the car.  He kicks another time, using the back of the seat to add more force as he pushes himself through the windshield.

Glass tears at his clothes and skin, leaving varying sized gashes in both, blood oozing, he cries out in pain, but continues through the windshield, shifting his weight to his feet by pressing off of the steering wheel.  Quick looks around, officers in the front car are unbuckling their seat belts, the passenger further along in the process than the driver.

Dominic springs forward, off of the hood of his car, jumping at the officer in the passenger seat, his leg half way out of the car.  Dominic's foot connects with the door, the force of his momentum pinioning the officer's leg between the body of the car and the door.

The officer cries out in pain, collapsing back into the patrol car.  The driver has both feet on the ground, and is beginning to stand up while this is happening.  Dominic grabs the bottom edge of the door, and swings under the car, sliding under the car, legs first.  His legs intertwine the driver's legs, and he uses a leveraging motion to swing himself out from under the car, at the same time, sending the driver to the ground.  Stun gun out, tagging the driver before he can react. He stays down, twitching from the stunpatch.

*Two down, two to go*  He peeks up from behind the opened driver side door.  They are advancing, stun guns out.  *Fuck*.  He looks inside the patrol car. "Driver incapacitated, vehicle disabled." is scrolling across the heads up display.  *Smart cookies activating the anti-car-jack feature*

The officers from the other car are advancing with measured caution, slow steps, ensuring shielding between them and Dominic.  Dominic pulls out the laser knife out from this patrol car.  The laser knife hums to life as he thumbs the on switch.  He peeks his head up and a stunpatch whizzes passed his ear.  *that was close*  He tosses the laser knife at the officer who shot at him.  The blade is balanced surprisingly well, and spirals through the air, in a slow graceful arc, hitting the officer's shield squarely, then sliding down to the ground, melting the shield into two pieces.

The laser knife sparks off the ground, popping and sizzling.  The officers look down at it, and Dominic is in motion.  In a quick hopping motion, he is over the door, sprinting full speed at the office who shot at him.  Two steps left, he leaps into the air, hitting the officer squarely in the chest, they take to the air, a brief moment, clearing the laser knife, and landing on the ground.

Stunned from the fall, the officer grasps at the ground, trying to stand.  Dominic rolls to a sliding stop well passed the officer's head.  As he stands to continue running, a stunpatch hits him squarely on the back, and he collapses to the ground.

# Ji

"We have him, sir," the voice crackling over the bad radio connection.

"Copy that, bring him to the prison, he's destined for an isolation chamber."  Ji vibrates with excitement, her voice laces with glee.  "See, Jameson, we always get our man!"

"I'm Johnson, sir."

"Where is Jameson?" she looks around.

"I believe he called in sick.  Something about not feeling well, and passing out."

"I thought I saw him badge in this morning?"

"No, sir."

"Huh. maybe that was yesterday."

"Possibly, he was working yesterday, showing the new guy around."

"New guy?"

"Private Maksimov.  Transfer from some other company.  Seems voluntary."

"What other company?"

"He wouldn't say, something about an NDA."

"Where is this Maksimov?"

"He's outside.  The general has him gardening.  I don't think he likes having another general in the prison.  Maksimov used to be a general at his old company.  That's what I heard, at least."

"Huh," her mood depresses as she ponders this new arrival.  *Could he be the extraction agent?  Nah, no one is that fast.  It would take months for him to insinuate himself, and even them, years before he was given access to the isolation cells.*

She pulls up Maksimov's employee records.  His company badge photo is blurry, out of focus, and there is little details about his past.  Large chunks of his record are long black bars.  She does not have clearance.

***

She is outside, smoking a nicostick, when the patrol car pulls to a stop in front of the prison.  Dominic is slumped against the window of the back seat, his face smushed up against the glass.  The driver steps out of the car.  "We have him, ma'am."

Ji licks her lips, extinguishes the nicostick, and walks towards the car.  "Stunpatch?"  The officer nods his head.  "And his vitals are fine?"

"Better than I would have expected.  He's in excellent shape, almost like he's not even stunned."

Ji nods her head.  "Let's get him into the cell immediately."

The officers pull him out of the patrol car, hefting him between their arms.  Ji walks into the prison, leading the procession.

The cadets from the control room are pressing their faces against the glass like children waiting for a candy shop to open, eyes wide with wonder.  They whisper back and forth to each other.

Ji scans open the isolation cell vault, the cell walls go translucent as they enter.  "That's not supposed to happen."  The prisoners all advance to the walls, peering out at the new inmate.  "Careful, let's keep him away from view of that one."  She points in Max's direction.  "Otherwise, we might have some problems on our hands."

She pauses for a moment, and grabs a black bag off a nearby table, and sticks it over Dominic's head.  "Better, now there is no chance."  The prisoners are banging on the wall, yelling, though inaudible for the sound proofing of the cells.

One inmate is not at his cell wall, banging.  He never bangs, never moves from his mediation except to sleep and eat.  She steers them clear of this cell.  She shivers when she catches a glimpse of him.  He has been in there for longer than she has been at Nakitashi.  Rumors fly around this place, and the rumor around him is that he is Akio Nakitashi's father, a rebellious man who tried to stop his son's take over.  Those are rumors.  From her best glimpses of him, he is not Japanese, so the rumors hold little credence for her.

Under Ji's instruction, they place Dominic in the cell next to Max's cell.  "These two are top priority for guarding.  I want at least two guards in here at all times.  Do not trust this one."  She points at Dominic.

"Where is Jameson?!" The officers shrug.  "Okay, fine."  She walks into the hallway, "You!" she points at a cadet walking down out of the woman's bathroom.  "Do you know this new private Maksimov?"  The cadet shakes her head.  "He's outside, tending the lawn.  Have him report to me, here, immediately."  She nods her head and runs off down the hallway.


# Vienne

"Vienne, we should just drive, get in the car and drive away from here."  Simon's hands are pressing into her shoulders.

Tears are streaming down Vienne's face, "I know, I know."

Simon leads her to the car, helping her get into the passenger side door.  He runs off as she sits in the car, sobbing deeply.

He reappears with two backpacks, clothes stuffed in, unfolded, zipper pulled tight over the disarray, not full closed.

She inhales deeply, wiping her face.  As he's throwing the bags into the back seat, she shifts over into the driver's seat.  He slams the back door, crosses over to the passenger side again, and gets into the car.  She fingers the garage door open, and starts the car.

NewTek did not invest in the drone mesh network like Nakitashi did.  As a result, their cars are not self-driving.  The most advanced collision avoidance system that NewTek installs in their employee cars is entirely self-contained and disconnected.  Programming and security updates happen when parked at the owner's house.

She shifts the car into reverse, and depresses the accelerator sharply.  They lurch backward, swinging into the street.  She shifts the car into turbo mode, and they speed down her neighborhood's on ramp onto the highway.

They drive in silence for an hour, the car rumbling along the daily commuters, and the long haul truckers, until the traffic thins, the herd of cars dwindling to the lost sheep.  The city fades out of view finally, and Vienne begins to breath normally again.

"Where are we going to go?"  Simon asks.  His legs are fold up in front of him, chin resting on his knees.

"Nakitashi.  Ji said they might protect us."

"That's a long way to go for might"  Simon's voice cracks.

"What other option is there?"  She looks at him for a brief moment, and then flicks her eyes back to the road.  She reaches out and runs her fingers through his hair.  "Don't worry, I'll take sure you are okay."

He half smiles, and then turns to stare out the window.  The stretches of urban ruins are endless here.  As far as his eye can see, the remnants of strip malls, long since abandoned, call out to the weary traveler.

His breath is fogging up the window as he talks, "The bottom feeders live in these strip malls, corporation-less tribes of feral humans, their beady eyes staring out, beckoning to those easily enticed."

"Simon, you know the bottom feeders are just legend, right?"

"I don't want to be corporation-less, Vienne.  That's worse than death."

"Don't worry, Simon, we'll be okay.  If not Nakitashi, maybe we try somewhere back east.  And if that doesn't work, I still have friends in France."

Simon draws an arrow in the fog on the window.

# Levi

Levi is standing guard on the inside of the isolation cell doors.  The echoes of his foot tapping against the concrete floor causes Officer Jannick, a tall woman with curly auburn hair to squint her eyes at him.

The muscles of her arms ripple and strain her uniform shirt, as she picks up a tray off of the food cart.  She swipes the controls on the cell the walls translucent as a small window opens.  She depositing the tray inside with a bang that overpowers Levi's tapping, swiping the cell opaque again.

"Fucking waitress duty again.  Ji Go isn't even in the military.  Fucking security assholes."  Another food tray bangs onto the small metal ledge inside of the cell.

"I can finish up for you, sir.  I'm stuck in here anyway."  Levi forces his voice to an even tone.

"Yeah whatever," she drops the tray back onto the cart and starts to leave.

"Did Ji Go say we needed two in here at all times?"

Levi shakes his head, "Not that I recall."  His jaw clenches and releases as she turns her head to leave.

"Whatever." And the door slides closed behind her.

As soon as the door seals shut, Levi springs into action.  His pace is hurried, and he reaches the internal control console.  He switches the wrist profile to Officer Jameson's profile.  He initiates silent lockdown, this will seal the isolation chambers without alerting the prison system, but it does register in central processing.  He sets his wrist to countdown fifteen minutes.

Quickly he moves over to Max's cell, releases the latch.  The wall falls into the floor.  Max looks up, bleary-eyed, blinking.  "What? What's going on?"

"You are leaving.  You are being recruited by NewTek International Holdings, Ltd.  Your cooperation is not necessary."

Max backs up into his cell, distance between him and Levi.

Levi rolls his eyes, "Where are you going go?"  He advances into the cell.

The clunk of a vent dropping to the ground echoes out into the room.  

Levi turns around, and begins to walk towards the entrance to the cell, sneaking a glance out the cell.  Dominic stands in the middle of the room, a stun baton liberated from the guard post in his hands, his breathes labored as his eyes settle onto Levi.

# Dominic

Dominic's shirt is torn to shreds from the earlier fight, so he discards it into the corner of the room.  Sweat drips from his naked chest as he readies himself for another attempt.

He is standing with his back against one wall, and he launches, coming up to a full sprint in a short moment.  He jumps, landing his foot half way up the wall, his leg compresses under him, and he launches himself higher.

This time his fingers connect with the grate in the center of the ceiling, firm grasping the grate.  From his countless hours in this cell, he knows he grate is in two parts, either of which are big enough for him to slip through.

He adjusts his grip, and swings a foot up into the other half of the grate, and it swings in.  He hooks his foot onto an unseen ledge, pushing down, leveraging himself up into the ventilation shaft.

The shaft is large, huge volumes of air move through it in slow gusts.  On all fours, he makes his way in the direction of the center of the isolation tank.  A similar grate sits at the center of the room, and he peers down it.  *Two Guards*  He waits, breath held, listening, but the woosh of air blocks the exchange, but one of the guards leaves.

*If he comes under the grate* but the guard does not.  He is rushing around, and opens a cell.  Dominic watches him enter the cell.  *This could be my only chance*

He kicks sharply at the grate, and it drops down to the ground.  He grabs the edge of the other half of the grate, and levers himself down into the opening, hanging for a brief moment.  He spots the ground and lets go, falling quickly to the ground.  His knees begin to absorb the fall, but the force is too much, so he tucks into a roll, and then back onto his feet.

The guard's weapon lock box is open, but it is vacant every weapon except a stun baton.  Dominic runs over to grab the baton.  Once it is in hand, he turns around.  Levi sticks his head out of the cell.  Their eyes lock.

In an instant, Dominic is launching himself at Levi, stun baton crackling with energy.  Dominic telegraphs his baton swing giving Levi enough time to duck out of the way, as it swings over his head.  Levi grabs Dominic's wrist, twisting it up, trying to force Dominic's hand to release the baton.

Dominic's right leg sweeps behind Levi's left, but the move is anticipated, deftly stepping up as the foot sweeps the ground.  The leverage on Dominic's arm is increasing, forcing him to lower himself to the ground.

With a sudden movement, Dominic drops to the ground, and connects his feet into Levi's sternum.  Pressing up and behind him, Dominic tosses Levi to the ground behind him.  The hold on Dominic's wrist disengages, and Dominic rolls to a standing position.  He sees Max, causing him to pause.

"Behind you!" Max yells, and Dominic ducks just in time for a wild haymaker from Levi.  Dominic swings the baton around, connecting with Levi's neck.  Quick convulsions, and then Levi's limp body is pressing into Dominic, heavy, unmanageable.  He dumps Levi to the side, and runs over to Max.  They embrace, followed by tongues intertwining forcefully, hands running through hair.

Max pushes Dominic away.  "Holy shit."

"Sorry you saw that." Dominic shrugs, looking back at Levi's unconscious body.

"That guy was an extraction agent."

"Oh?"

"Yeah for your employer." He punches Dominic in the chest, slightly knocking the wind out of him.

"Max, it's complicated."  He eyes searching the cold, dirt-smeared mask of Max's face.

"You were paid to make me love you.  Like a whore."  His words sharp, piecing, cut off at each syllable.

"At the beginning, sure."

"You are heartless!"  tears begin to trickle down Max's face, streaking clean spots through the dirt.

"Max, I'm not heartless.  I fell in love with you, that's why I'm here.  NewTek will kill everyone involved in this project.  I can only assume my handler is dead, and now that this guy," Dominic takes a moment to kick him in the side, "has failed to extract you, they'll be coming after you, but we can go corporateless, live out in the badlands.  It's not that bad."

The isolation tank door chunks unlocked, and slides open.  Six armed guards are pointing assault rifles at them as they turn to look in the direction.  Ji walks through the door, between the guards, coming towards them.

Dominic instinctively steps in front of Max, shielding him from her advance.

"Nic, Nic, Nic.  Good job disposing of this NewTek agent.  She motions to Levi.  "I knew someone in the prison was the extraction agent.  I had a hunch it was this mysterious motherfucker."

"Ji, look, I'm sure you've heard things about what I did… wait a second, what are you doing here?"

"She's top brass in security at Nakitashi!" Max stammers.  Dominic's face goes slack-jawed.

"Don't look so surprised.  I'm quite good at what I do.  I even had Vienne convinced."

"Vienne?"

"Your ex-wife.  Your handler." she attitude flowing from her head weave as she accentuates each sound.

"You were working for NewTek, too?"

"I was playing them for the fools they are.  I guess Maksimov didn't get the memo though."

"What are you going to do with me now, Ji?"  Dominic bends down, and puts handcuffs on Levi.

"We are willing to give you protection from NewTek."

"What's the catch?"

"You have to help us take them down."

"Or?"

She motions her hands behind her.  "They open fire, a prisoner escape attempt appropriately squashed.  Dominic Quinn rendered neutralized.  Poor Max Bosko caught in the cross fire."

"Wait a minute!" Max screams.  He walks towards Ji, "I didn't do anything wrong!"

"Okay, Poor Max Bosko was injured during the escape attempt."

"I guess I have no choice but to take your offer, huh?"

Ji shrugs, turning away from him, "pretty much.  Guards?  Strip them down, put them in interrogation room five, hands bound.  Use the MagCuffs."

# Max

The cold metal chairs are cold against their naked flesh as the guards push them down onto the chairs.  The cuffs activate, and their hands are shackled to the backs of the chairs.

Max, with fire in his eyes, looks at Dominic in the mirrored wall across from them as the guards leave the room.  The door snaps shut.

"Your wife?" his voice measured, a cutting edge dragging across every sound.

"Can we not do this right now?"

"What else are we going to do, Nic?  Wait for Ji to come electrocute our balls to get information out of us?"

"That would feel weird."

"Dominic, what the fuck?"

Dominic tries to twist the chair to face Max, but the chair is bolted into the ground, unmoving.  He turns back towards the mirror, and his eyes cannot help but trace their way up Max's exposed body.

"Look, Vienne was a lot time ago.  You knew I had women in my past, but that does not mean I don't love you."

"You mean, you were paid to love me.  Like a prostitute."

Dominic shakes his head, lowering his gaze at the ground. "Yes, like a prostitute.  I'm a whore, is that what you want me to say?"

"It's a start."

"It was a job, at the beginning.  It was a very good job, lots of money, fun toys to play with, but somewhere along the way, I stopped caring about those things, and started caring about you.  I started to really love you."

"How can I believe you?"

"I…I don't know," his voice low, his words spilling out of his mouth as a slow trickle, matching the tear rolling down his cheek.

The door whirs open, and Ji is silhouetted against the intense light of the hallway.  The stun baton she is holding crackles with maniacal vigor.

"That was so touching," disdain creeps through her every word.  

She leans her head back out the door.  "Black Ops, shut off the cameras," shorts orders to unseen agents.  She punches a few commands into the wall-mounted terminal, and a shutter slides down over the mirror.

"No witnesses."

She punches in a few more commands, and the door slides closed, the thunk of the security bolts echo through the room.

"No interruptions."

She fondles the stun baton in crude, lurid movements.

"Get on with it." Dominic's voice deadpan, but soft.

She looks up at the ceiling, mumbling words to herself.  The lights in the room dip in intensity twice.  "Okay good, cameras are off."

An edge of panic laces Max's words, "What, what are you going to do to us?"

# Levi

Levi's eyes slowly gain focus on the ventilation grate above the bed in his isolation cell.  His hands roughly fettered behind his back, the weight of his body pressing into his wrists.

He rolls off the bed, landing on his feet.  The quiet slap of his bare feet against the smooth stone bounces around the little room for a brief moment before dissipating to nothing.

He looks around the room. *Step one, remove restraints*  If he had been conscious when they were attached, he would have made his wrists seem bigger, making it easier to slip out of them, but they are on tight.  Now he must improvise.

He has his belt.  He sits down on the ground, slipping his arms under his feet.  Unbuckling his belt, he removes it from his pants.  Hidden behind the belt buckle is a survival knife.  He slips it out of the sheath, and slides the handle between his knees.  He runs the restraints over the small blade in quick succession.  He counts the slices.  *52* The restraints fall to the ground.

The occasionally vibration in his wrist signaling a waiting message has been happening for two hours now.  He fingers his wrist, and the first message reads out on the holoprojector.  "Levi, change of contract, extraction target now Ms. Vienne Baune plus one for extraction to Nakitashi from NewTek.  Please confirm receipt," flashes across the screen.  He swipes that message away, and the second message appears, "Contract Canceled.  Payment in full.  Vienne Baune no longer employed by NewTek".

He shrugs, and swipes the second message away.  "Next order of business, get the fuck out of Nakitashi."

He bangs on the wall.  A moment passes, and he knocks again.  After the third time, the small window opens.

One of the nameless cadets' mouths appears in the window.  "What do you want?"

"My contract was canceled.  By order of the involuntary extraction clause of the UCSA charter, I am absolved from all possible corporate infractions in the pursuit of carrying out my contract at such a time as the contract is canceled as not fulfilled."

"I don't have the authority to release you."

"Then go find someone who does, or I shall be forced to contact the MENU to enact their peacekeeper duties and enforce the rights of the union for its member, namely me."

"One second."  The window slides shut, and a soft murmur can be heard.  Minutes pass, and Levi stands, staring at the little window.

The wall becomes translucent, and then falls to the floor.  The general is standing on the other side as the wall falls into the groove in the floor.

He has his finger up to his ear.  He holds up the index finger on his other hand.  Levi taps his foot.  The general nods his head a couple of times.

"MENU verified the contract cancelation.  I will escort you out of here, and then you will be free to go.  And by go, I mean, immediately leave Nakitashi territories because if any other corporate infractions happen or you are still trespassing on Nakitashi properties by tomorrow, you'll find yourself back here, but so deep in our black ops site that even your mother won't remember you being born."

"Colorful."  He raises his eyebrows, "Trust me, I'm done with this place."

# Simon

Vienne is fast asleep in the backseat, and Simon's eyes are glued to the road, a single spotlight of his headlights piercing out of the darkness ahead of them.  This is the part of the trip up the coast that he hates.  The giant-bore tunnel straight through the Siskiyou Mountain Range.  Once the world's oil supply ran dry, all cars were converted to electric/solar, and a vast network of charging stations were setup to allow continuous nighttime driving.

However, the electric cars do not have enough power to make it up the mountain.  Some politician turned corporate planner suggested to the UCSA board that a large-bore tunnel would be the solution.  It took them ten years to drill the tunnel, running two boring machines from each direction.

The problem is the tunnel impossibly long, and impossibly dark, and the batteries do not last.  Simon notes the battery level, one quarter left.  A charging station should be coming up any moment.

But in the darkness of the tunnel, an underworld thrives, bandits equipped with nightvision, and real guns, the kind that shoot real bullets, and make people real dead.  Simon reaches into his bag in the back seat, stealing brief glances behind him, eyes returning to the road.  Vienne stirs as he jerks the car to the side.

"Where are we?"

"The tunnel, nearing the first charging station."

"Oh.  What are you digging for?"  She swats his hand away, he looks back at her for a brief moment.

"My gun."

She pulls out a stun gun.  "A stun gun?  That's not going to help."

"I should have a flare gun in there.  I thought we could pop off a couple of flares in each direction so we can't be ambushed so easily."

"We could activate the emergency lighting system."

"If we had access."

She pulls out a key card with a small metal square on it and veins radiating out to the edges.  "Courtesy of NewTek.  I thought it might be useful."

"Oh Brilliant!"  the lingering vestiges of his childhood spent in London surface briefly.

The small, bluish light of the recharging station looms ahead of the car, and Simon pulls into the station.  Vienne jumps out of the backseat, running to the station's control panel.  She inserts the key card, and presses the large red button.  The tunnel becomes ablaze with aggressive floor lights, flickering on in all directions.  The smooth-bored walls, around up around them.  The emergency lights are embedded within the upper crest of the tunnel, shining down.

Simon exits the car, noticing figures in the distance scurrying away into holes and doorways hidden from the main channel of the tunnel.  He pulls the charging cable from the hood of the car, and attaches it to the charger.  He passes his wrist over the scanner, and punches in "Fast charge, Maximum Power".  The device calculates the price and displays it.  He shakes his head, and hit the "go" button.

# Ji

Ji deactivates the MagCuffs from Max's wrists, handing him a robe.  She walks to Dominic, and stands over him, looking down.

Max rubs his wrists, "What's going on?"

"I'm going to ask your lover boy here a couple of questions, and then I'm going to help you escape."

Dominic looks up at Ji, "Help us escape?"

"Yes, I'll explain after you answer a couple of questions."

Dominic shakes his head, "yeah, sure?  Hopefully I can."

"How long have you been working for NewTek?"

"Since I was fifteen. They caught me skimming credits from their corporate bank, gave me a choice."

"Wow, ten years?"

"Something like that."

"Are you still working for them?"  She holds the stun baton against the chair, between his legs, dangerously close to scrotum.

"Technically? I don't know.  Practically? fuck no." His head jerks to the side, emphasizing the end of his sentence.

"Are you a cocksucker?"

"What the fuck, Ji?"

"Okay, Okay. I don't really care.  We are going to get you out of here."

She deactivates the MagCuffs on Dominic's wrist.  No robe is offered.  He rolls his eyes, shaking his head in disbelief.

"Who is we?"  Max chimes in.

"The WLF."

Dominic and Max in unison, "What?!"

Max continues, "I thought you worked for Nakitashi?"

Dominic finishes, "And I thought you worked for NewTek?"

Ji waves her hands, "You are both right and wrong.  I'm a Worker's Liberation Front warrior.  I've collected enough information to make down Nakitashi and NewTek all at once, and restore the left coast to its utopian democratic ideals, and you are both my ticket to doing it."

Dominic's mouth folds into a dubious pose as he squints his eyes are her.  "How?"

"Simple, Max's mind control device."

"The plans were destroyed," the center of his eyebrows raise up and his blinking becomes rapid.

Dominic goes over to Max, embracing him, his naked flesh pressing into Max's terry cloth robe.  "Not exactly." He holds up a small cylinder between him and Max.  "I might have saved a copy before I destroyed the ones on Nakitashi's systems."

Max punches Dominic in the stomach, sending him to the ground, the cylinder clanging heavy onto the ground.

"I deserve that. What's my part?"

"You'll infiltrate the boardrooms of each company, and use the device on the boards of directors.  Then order them to give voting rights to every employee, and enact a right to work clause in the company charter that expressly allows employees to seek work elsewhere."

"That seems a bit tidy."  Dominic stands up, recovered from the punch.  Max's eyes burn holes into Dominic's chest.  "Will that even work?"

"We hope so.  The backup plan is for you to blow up the boardrooms."

His head lulls back as he rolls his eyes. "I'm not a terrorist, corporate or otherwise."

Ji shakes her head, "I thought you would sympathetic to our cause."  She presses the stun baton into his pelvis. It's been dialed down to a sharp but not incapacitating level.  Dominic writhes in pain, screaming through clenched teeth.

She remove the baton, and Max is at Dominic's side with quick steps, no hesitation.

"You'll do what you must do, now let's get you out of here.  I have a quad-rotor up on the roof.  You'll use that to escape.  The ventilation shaft here," she removes the grate from a floor level ventilation register, "will take you to the roof."

Dominic returns to his feet, a small electrical burn marks the point of contact with the stun baton.

"How are we supposed to pilot it?"

"I know how to fly those," Max's voice quiet and laced with exhaustion.

Ji and Dominic turn to look at Max, mouths slack, opposite eye brows cocked at inquisitive angles.

"My dad was a pilot, he taught me when I was twelve." Max shrugs.

"Then get going!"

"What about clothes?"

"In the quad."

Max ducks into the grate, followed closely by Dominic.  His smooth butt cheeks disappear into the darkness of the grate as Ji looks on, her head barely moving in a nodding motion.

# Dominic

The ventilation shaft is small with little room to maneuver.  Crawling on all fours through the tiny metal cave, they make slow progress.

*In any other situation, I'd bury my head in that* Dominic stares ahead at Max's butt.  His voice low, in hushed tones, "Nice view from back here."

Max gentle kicks a leg back towards Dominic, connecting with his shoulder as he dodges his head to the side.

For what seems like eternity, they creep along the metal surface until the shaft turns sharply up, vertical to the roof.  The vertical shaft is twice the size of the one from which they just emerged.  Dominic looks up at the smooth, endless metal skylight.

"How far up do you think it is?"

"Looks like ten stories, Max."

"How the fuck are we supposed to climb ten stories?"

Dominic looks around, turning around to get a good look.  He is forced to move Max with him because of the dimensions of the shaft, their bodies pressing against each other, friction causing reactions.  Dominic left side of his mouth raises in a wry smirk.

Max rolls his eyes, "Nic, will you focus?"

"It is pretty hard… to focus."

"What's this?" Max pulls a small tab in the wall of the shaft, and a small compartment opens.  Max reaches in and pulls out two MagLift Ascension Assistive devices and a small note card.  Max hands the card to Dominic while looking over the MagLifts.

"Here, boys, use this to get to the roof -Momma Bear.  I think she wants her code name to be Momma Bear." Dominic laughs.

Dominic looks up from the card, and Max is gone.  His head snaps left and right, spinning around in a circle before he looks up.  The MagLift strapped around Max's waist is rocketing him to the sky.

He picks the second MagLift up off the ground, and straps around his waist.  The blue power button begins to throb once the buckle is fastened; Depressing the button, and he is jerked upward by the MagLift, the card slipping out of his hand, falling in a haphazard manner as it settles delicately on the floor of the shaft.

The MagLift works on the same principles as a railgun.  Its only use is in ascending small cramped quarters, or narrow shoots of high iron content rock.  *Good thing Ji plans things out.*

The upward thrust of the MagLift continues to increase the longer it is activated and the ten stories are cleared in a matter of minutes.  The final jolt of force pushes him up out of the ventilation shaft.  He hovers about the hole for a brief moment before tumbling to the adjacent roof.  The MagLift clicks off. 

Max is pulling on a pair of TacPants, the heavy canvas material drapes under its own weight.  He pulls on a tight-fitting gray shirt, and tosses Dominic the second duffle bag.

Dominic slips his own pair of TacPants on, pulling the cinch belt tight.  As the shirt slips over Dominic's head, "Nic, what are we going to do?"

"How do you feel about working with WLF?"

"I don't hate the idea," Max rummages around the duffle bag, pulling a protein bar from the depths.  He rips open the wrapper, and takes a bite, chewing while he talks, "But I don't think her plan is going to work."

"I know.  But we could take out Nakitashi's main processing center.  That would decommission the company.  They would not be able to enforce their power."

"How?"

"Main tower, that entire second half of the tower is all heat sinks.  Disrupt those, and the place burns.

"Does NewTek have a similar setup?"

"Most of the tech being used by these corporations were designed by the same company, so it should be the same attack vector."

"How do we disrupt it?"

Dominic shrugs, and walks over to the quad, sitting down in the passenger seat. "Not a fucking clue."  Max walks over and takes the pilot's seat, looking over at Dominic.

"This thing has rockets!" Max's voice like a child on Christmas morning coming downstairs to find a new bicycle for a present.

"Ji thought of everything."

Max powers on the quad-rotor, and the blades begin to come up to speed, the drone of the air being chopped to pieces raises in volume, and the quad raises up in the sky, marionette on invisible strings.

The central processing tower looms over the horizon as Max swings the quad to face it, throttling up, closing the distance.

"We need to be quick.  Who knows what kind of defenses this thing might have.  I'll need to shoot the rocket through the metal cage and get a direct hit on the base of the heat sinks."  Max's voice staticky over the comm system of the quad.

Dominic nods.  They fly the rest of the way to the tower in silence as Max concentrates on keeping them on the right course.

As the tower begins to take up most of his vision, Max arms the left rocket tube.  "I've never shot a rocket before.  Though it looks like it has a laser guide," Max points at the bright green dot on the metal cage.  They hover at the base of the heatsinks.  "Looks like we have eight shots.  Hope we don't need them."

As they get closer to the tower, a siren pierces the air and the strobe of warning lights begin the flash on the side of the tower.  Over the comm system, a mechanical voice warns, "You have breached high security airspace, turn back now.  Ground to Air Missiles have been armed."

"Fuck, you need to shoot, now!"

Max takes aim, adjusting the quad's position so the laser guide lands on the base of the heatsink stack.  He pulls back on the trigger, but nothing happens.

"Fuck, the rocket didn't launch."

"Is it armed?"

"Yes!"

"What's the light?" Dominic points to a flashing red button labeled "safety engaged".

Max reaches down the press it, the flashing stops as a missile whooshes passed quad.  "Fuck that was close." He pulls the trigger, and a rocket ignites and speeds out of the left tube, connecting heavily with the heatsink.  A small explosion on impact, and the heatsink begins to careen down from the top of the tower.

"Get us out of here!" Dominic is screaming into the comm system, distorted by the mic, turning into buzzing hard sounds in Max's ear as he spins the quad around, and throttles up.  A second missile blazes passed them.

# Max

Max rubs his eyes.  They have been flying for five hours, his focus is waning.  Dominic snores in the passenger seat.  A yawn escapes Max's body.  He reaches over to nudge Dominic.  "Wake up, I need to find a place to land and take a break."

Dominic grunts, "What?"

"I need to land, help me find a place."  He points to the navigation system maps, "Use that, find me a place to land, I need some sleep."

"There is a large stretch coming up, in what used to be Medford, if I'm reading this map correctly.  It's now a large commune in no-man's-land."

"That sounds good, they don't take allegiances."

"About 50 miles south.  From the sat images, it looks like we'll be able to see the lights."

Max punches on the autonav system, and releases the control stick.  "Any news on Nakitashi?"

"There was a statement by the WLF taking credit for it, and the Governess of the UCSA is swearing to bring the full might of the union security force on the leaders of the WLF."

"Like they even know who they are."

"Right?  Oh, here is a statement from Nakitashi. 'Two recently escaped agents of NewTek International Holdings, LTD. are responsible for the attack, and we will be seeking restitution through the UCSA'"

"How do they rectify that with the wolf statement?" Max takes his eyes off the sky and looks at Dominic.  Dominic's hair is a wild mess from sleeping, strands fly in every direction. *guh, such a pretty boy, even with bed head*

Dominic shrugs.

"I love you, Nic, even though you lied to me, I still love you."

Dominic smiles, placing his hand on top of Max's hand.  "I know, and I love you too."

# Vienne

Vienne drives the car out of the tunnel.  Signals reacquire, and she punches up the navigation system on the heads up display.  Sign posts are superimposed over the road.  "Medford Commune, thirty miles" is the largest sign post.

She nudges Simon awake.  His eyes half open, and he sits up, rubbing his eyes.  "I need to pee."

"How badly?  We'll be at the commune in about twenty-five minutes."

"I should be able to hold it.  We are near Medford?"

Vienne nods her head, eyes remaining on the road.  The road is solitary, the only car on the road.  Back in the sunlight, the car will go significantly faster, and they can drive until the sunsets and the battery runs down again.  They drive on in silence

***

They pull to a stop in front of the commune dormitory as the sun finally dips below the horizon, the shadows long and deep across the flat parking lot.  "Remember, they have all taken a vow of silence and are sensitive to noises, so speak quietly, and try to avoid too much noise."  Simon nods his head listening to her words carefully.

They exit the car, and walk up to the dormitory, pulling open the door.  A young woman, with long, straight black hair and the distinctive eye shape of Asian heritage, sits at the front desk, reading a torn and tattered paperback. What is left of the cover reveals a shirtless man with bulging biceps on the cover, his long hair flowing in the imaginary wind.

In hushed tones, "Sanctuary for the night?"  Vienne pulls a couple of paper bills from her pocket, and hands them to the woman.  Old currency, she spent considerable time stockpiling the money of the badlands, just in case.

The young woman puts her book down, receives the bills, and reaches back, fishing for a key off the key board.  She pulls room 312 and hands it to Vienne.  The woman does a half bow as Vienne takes the key, extending her arm to point to the stairwell.  She holds up three fingers, and then picks her book back up.

Vienne grabs Simon's hand, and leads him to the stairwell.  He is loaded down with their bags, his steps heavy, echoing through the quiet hallway.

# Max

The lights of the Medford Commune light up the sky in front of them.  Max shifts the engines to being vertical thrusters again, and slowly lowers the throttle, descending smoothly into a grassy field next to the only large building in the area.

Max collapses back against his chair as the quad's rotors drag to a stop.  A number of people as exiting the building.  They stare at the quad, eyes searching.  A little child squeals with excitement.  Max stumbles out of the vehicle, and approaches the crowd, Dominic following a few steps behind.  Max stretches his hands out to his side, a sign of peace, as he walks forward.

An old man with dark skin walks forward, out of the group, meeting Max half way.  Max bows deeply to this man, and then proffers his hand in greeting.

"Sir, we are two travelers who need sanctuary for the night."

The man's mouth opens, but no sounds come out.  A wide smile grows from his mouth, and he gestures inside.  Max and Dominic walk towards the small group of people.  They part a passageway into the building for Max and Dominic, and the man follows them directly.

# Levi

The open road stretches out to infinity for Levi, but he is not going anywhere.  His motorcycle sits on the side of the road, abandoned by him.  Levi is in the median between the two parts of the interstate, laying down in the grass, shielding his eyes from the light of the noon-day sun.  His body is crashing hard, the speed enhancers finally starting to wear off.

His body feels like lead.  His limbs press heavily into the grass, and any will to move is nonexistent in him.  The come down from Amphen is harsh, and he forgot to pack them as he left Nakitashi.  He will be stuck in this grass until his body adjusts, until it is all out of his system.

He had been driving south before the Amphen withdrawal kicked in, through lush pastures and desolate small towns, destroyed by the rise of the corporate states.  He is on the outskirts of the capitol city, a once-proud town now a ruin of government buildings and dilapidated public sculptures.  If only he could have made it to the city before the lethargy hit him, he might have been able to raid a pharmacy.

The rumble of a 'copter begins to doppler in from the direction of Nakitashi.  It passes over head in a cacophony of sounds that sends knives through Levi's head.  He risks opening his eyes to watch it pass, the light searing his retinas.  "Fuck!" in elongated whispers.  The intense pain washing over his body is enough to cause his brain to decide enough is enough, and he passes out, arm draped over his eyes, the rest of him splayed out on the ground.

***

The sun is setting in the sky, and something is poking Levi in the side.  Poke. Poke. Poke in slow intervals.  As his eyes adjust to the crimson and orange light in the sky, the face of a young boy begins to form out of the void.

From the distance, a woman's voice, "Don't go pokin' dead bodies now, Angwah."

"Momma, he ain't dead."

Levi begins to stand up, faltering, his legs collapsing under him.  He tries a second time, and manages to stand.  The boy, Angwah, is dirty, smudges of road dirt cover his face, darkening his blond hair, and turning his white tank top gray.  He holds a large stick, taller than he is.  He looks to be about six years old.

"Get away from him, Angwah!" The woman is equally blond, and equally dirty.  She wears simple gray pants, and a tank top like her son's.  Angwah runs away with uncoordinated limbs waddling under him.  "Whatcha doin' here?"

"I had to stop for… health reasons."  Levi spreads out his hands as a gesture of innocence.  "I'm unarmed."

She trains a rifle on Levi's head. "Too bad for you.  Don't move."

"Ma'am, I mean you no harm, I'd like to just get on my bike and continue on my way."

"That ain't gonta happ'n"

Levi's head unhinges from his neck, dangling as he puts his index and thumb on the bridge of his nose.

"Why not?"

"You trespassin'"

"Trespassing? On what? The highway?  It's public land."

"Nah, it not. It ma land. You trespassin'"

"It was an honest mistake."

"Ain't honest, stranger, your lying."  Keeping the gun draw on Levi, she approaches him.  "You one of those 'borgs with the wrist thing.  Show me, slow like."

Levi slowly raises his hand, showing the wrist implant.  She slips a rope around the wrist, and pulls down sharply, cinching the loop around his wrist.  "Now other one."  His other hand is extended, and she wraps it, pulling his hands together, the rope pressing hard into his skin.  She lowers the rifle, and continue to bind his hands.  When done, she yanks on the rope.  Levi stumbles from the force, but catches himself at the last moment.

She turns around, slinging the rifle over her shoulder, and pulls Levi behind her.  "Where are you taking me?"  Angwah falls into lock step next to her.  With her free hand, she ruffles his hair, finally resting it on his shoulder.

# Ji

The prison is in lock down, the normal reaction to losing connection to the central processing center.  Ji and cadet Johnson are locked in the control room, fail secure more activated.

"What's going on, Sir?" Johnson's voice shakes, cracking slightly as anxiety slithers into her voice.

"Lockdown, lost connection to the tower."

"Why would we lose connection?"

"Solar flares?  Who knows, we just need to wait until the all-clear is given.  You are safe in here."

Ji walks over to one of the terminals and begins typing, looking for some indication of what happened.  She is digging through log files on the system.  For security reasons, all central processing log files are mirrored directly to the security center.

"Huh?" Ji scratches her head.

"What, Sir?"

"Looks like the central processing system overheated."

"Is it something exceptional?"

"Very. The entire top half of the tower is heatsinks."  Ji accesses her wrist implant, connecting to the drone network.  She navigates to the security camera network, the entire city is covered in cameras, and her clearance gives her access to them.

"Oh fuck."

"What, Sir?"

"The tower was hit by a rocket."

"A rocket?"

"Yeah, hold on."  Ji scrubs through the recording, "those motherfuckers!"

"Sir?"

"The two escapees, they blew up the tower after they stole the quad-rotor."

Ji slams her fist into the table, muttering, "that was not part of the plan."

"Sir?"

She waves the question away with violent hands, returning to typing, her fingers banging hard into the keyboard, her typing quick and furious.

Cadet Johnson removes her hat and shakes out her tight, bouncy curls of brown hair.  The temperature is sharply rising in the room, the vents start spewing air, a mixture of lukewarm and hot air is flowing into the room.

A torrent of foul and unsavory words spew from Ji's mouth as she continues to mash on the keyboard.  After a long minute, with sweat beginning to soak through her uniform, the air begins to flow cool again.  The bolts of the security doors drop into the floor, and the doors begin to open.

"I overrode the lockdown, let's get out of here, I'm not sure how long until the watchdog kicks back in and reinitiates."  Ji pushes Johnson through the door.  Other officers and cadets are milling about.

# Dominic

The room they are given is small, but clean.  Dominic tosses his bag down on the ground, and flops down onto the bed.  "What a fucking bad couple of days."

Max stares from the door way. "Really? Our lives are completely fucked, Nic. We just blew up our employer's main core of operations.  You don't think they are going to send a hit squad after us?"

Dominic shrugs, rubbing his stomach, his shirt lifting up to above his navel. "We'll be okay."

"How can you say that?"

Dominic pops up off the bed, pulling Max into the room and closing the door behind him.  He hugs him with strong arms, flattening the space between them into oblivion.  He kisses Max's cheek, "Because I'm here, and we are going to take care of each other."

"Right. Against assassins," Max pushes away from Dominic, but Dominic yanks him back into the embrace.

"Exactly."  He spins Max around and pushes him down onto the bed, straddling his legs across Max's hips.  Max strains under the weight of Dominic's body without success.

"Get off."

"Nope, not until you smile."

Max's face contorts into a bitch-face version of a smile, a delicate mixture of smirk, sneer, and repulsion.  Dominic shakes his head, "Not good enough," and begins to tickle Max.

Breathless protests from Max as only mellowed by Dominic relenting, and letting Max up.  Breathing heavy to catch his breath, Max punches Dominic on the shoulder.  "Asshole," the smile not leaving his face.

Dominic sits back on his heals, pulling his knees up to his chin.  He wraps his arms around his legs, resting his chin on his left knee, smiling at Max.

"What?"

"Nothing."

"Stop staring at me."

"Can't."

Max picks up a pillow and throws it at Dominic's face, catching him off balance, sending him crashing to the floor, hitting his head on the nightstand.  Max rushes to him.  Dominic pulls his bloody hand away from his head.  He stares at the blood, disoriented.

"Fuck… fuck, fuck!" panic rising in Max's voice.  He rushes to the door, opening it, running down the hallway.

Dominic's vision is muddled as he sits on the ground.  The door is open, left open in Max's haste.  He must be seeing things, it must be a concussion because Vienne is standing in the doorway.

"Vienne?" his last words before he loses consciousness.

***

His awareness comes back before his connection to his body reestablishes itself.

Max and Vienne are talking, words not comprehended.

He understands words. "… concussion… blood…"

"… fine… tower… fleeing"

Things begin to connect together.

Vienne is inquiring, "You blew up the tower?"

"Not exactly, we destroyed the heatsink connection.  No lives lost, we hope, just took out their central operations.  It should take them a while before they can become functional again."

"Holy shit, I didn't think Nic had that in him?"

He can feel his body again, move again.  He sits up, head throbbing heavily, His hand instinctively goes to his head, rubbing the blood soaked bandage wrapped slipshod around the wound.  "I have alot in me, Vienne."

"Take it easy." Max is at his side, supporting his back, helping him adjust to lean against the wall.

"What are you doing here, V?"

"Simon and I," she points to Simon who is lurking in the doorway in boxers, arms folded against his chest, "were defecting to Nakitashi.  NewTek was going to eliminate us, you."

"Nakitashi is no more, at least for a while."

"I know, the news wires are abuzz about the UCSA sanctions being placed against NewTek right now for the direct attack on Nakitashi.  I didn't realize it was you who did it."

"Small miracles that it hasn't been leaked."

"The Governess is furious.  She is personally leading the witch hunt against NewTek."

Dominic closes his eyes, listing into Max, who supports him.

"Shit, I'm dizzy."

"You smacked your head pretty hard." Max steadies him.

"I know, I remember."  Dominic smiles.  "I'll be fine in the morning, what's the plan now?"

"Well, if you attack NewTek with the Nakitashi quad-rotor, it will look like a counterattack."

"That would get the UCSA's attention even further." Max offers.

"Right,  but we don't want that much attention." Dominic's words slur together, the effort to talk is weighing on him.

"We could turn states evidence, we have enough to make the UCSA take action against both," Max shrugs.

"That would be a bad idea.  The UCSA was sponsoring our little mission to recover what you invented, Max."

Dominic raises his hand an inch above his leg, letting it flop down with a slap.  All eyes are on Dominic now, "Ji. Wolf."

Max's eyes light up, "Ji is part of the WLF.  She could help!"

Vienne shakes her head. "No, Ji is unreliable."

"She helped us escape."  Max insists, and Dominic echoes with a small nod of his head.

Vienne stands, crossing her arms against her chest, pacing the room.  "Fine, I'll contact her."  She walks out of the room, down the hall into her own room.

Simon hovers for a moment, and Max smiles at him.  "You're adorable."  Blood flushes through Simon's face as he looks at the ground, becoming aware of his state of undress.

"I better go," he points his thumb down the hallway, and leaves.

Dominic pulls his head off the wall, "You are horrible," a small smirk appear on his face before his head sinks back to the wall.

"Get some rest."

# Vienne

The portable comm system's holoprojector is projecting Ji's face in the space above the bed.

"I'm asking for your help, Ji.  You and Wolf, you must help us."

"Why? Those fuck boys did not do what I asked them to, so why should I help any of you?"

"Because we have the same enemy."

"And you want to take down the UCSA?"

"Yes, we can expose them for the corruption, the underhanded scheming.  I have recordings of the Governess ordering people's executions.  We can take them down."

"And what will rise in their place?  Another serpent's head."

"Not if we destroy the body, the UCSA is the body."

"What can wolf do for you?"

"Release the recordings, verified authenticity through voice print analysis, release it wide for everyone to see.  Release it to the world."

"Aren't you in the recordings also?"

"Yes, as an agent of NewTek.  I'm willing to take that bullet."

"Figuratively or Literally?"

"Literally literally."

Ji's projection scratches her head, "And then what?"

"Then we get to Alexandrine and the cabinet.  Hold them hostage if necessary.  Demand change."  Vienne pounds the table with her fist, the image of Ji shimmers and waivers as the projector tries to stabilize the image.

Ji shakes her head.  "And the fuckboys are okay with this plan?"

Vienne puts her hands on her hips, "I'm in charge here, not them.  They'll do what's necessary."  Her voice trails off, "once Dominic's head is better."

"Let's say we do this, then what?"

"The world council will need to respond.  These are very seriously charges against the UCSA."

Ji nods.  "okay, I'll contact the WLF leadership, and we'll get back to you."

"Okay, we'll be at the–"

"–No, don't tell me where you are."

"Okay, okay."

"Stay safe until you hear from me."

# Levi

A black hood is over Levi's head.  He hears the murmur of voice in an adjacent room, but the words are muffled, and he cannot make them out.  After a few minutes, the sound of high heel shoes clicking on the stone floor start.  A door opens and shuts, it is an old fashioned door with hinges that creak as it moves.

The hood is removed in one quick motion, and a woman stands in front of him.  Sunlight streams in through her golden curls, and she wears a tracksuit in subtle pink.  She has a file folder in her hands, open like a choir book.

"Levi Kane, mercenary, extraction specialist. ex-NC Military.  Quite impressive."

Levi stares straight ahead, unmoving.

She exhales in a sharp "eh", a combination of a sigh and a laugh, "Okay then, I'll cut to the chase.  I'm Governess Brant of the United Corporate States of America, and your 'country'", she makes air quotes, "needs you."

His eyes meet hers with a slight turn of his head, left eyebrow rising.

"If my sources are correct, you were recently in the employ of NewTek International Holdings, Ltd, correct?"

His head nods once.

"Hired to extraction one Maximilian Bosko?"

Another nod.

"And your contract was canceled?"

A third nod.

"I'd like to reestablish that contract, but under the power of the UCSA.  Our full arsenal will be at your disposal.  Capture is very important, and you should eliminate anyone who has had contact with Mr. Bosko."

"How much?"

"Oh dear, you do not understand.  You are now part the UCSA, your every whim and desire will be catered to.  Money is no longer an issue for you."

Levi thinks for a moment, and nods one final time.  She releases the handcuffs with a small metal key, another anachronism, a comforting thing for Levi.

"Welcome aboard, soldier."

# Simon

Simon is sitting on the bed, cross legged reading a small tablet.  His black hair is wet, and matted against the head.  Droplets of water cling to his exposed chest and a soft terry cloth towel hangs over his shoulders.

Vienne opens the door and comes into the room.  Her hand is applying delicate pressure to her eyebrow ridge as she shakes her head.

"Everything alright, V?"

A deep inhale precedes a slow, exhausted exhale, "It will be.  The WLF is going to help us."

"That's good… right?"  Vienne nods her head at Simon's question.

Simon stands up, straightening out the legs of his boxers as he does, pulling Vienne close to him, folding her into his arms.  "You need some rest, lay down, I'll go find you a drink." As he starts to pull away, but her hands pull him back, and their lips meet for a long, fitful kiss, tongues wrestling for dominance.

"I do need some rest, and a drink would be lovely," as she flops back towards the bed.  Simon adjusts his boxers, his arousal quite prominent in his silhouette.

"I should probably put some pants on."

Vienne giggles, "Sorry."

Simon's eyes narrow at her comment, "No you aren't." He pulls on his pants, and adjusts the waistband of his boxers to hold his erection in place, ensuring the top of his penis isn't showing, and leaves the room.  Vienne's giggle is silenced when the door closes fully behind him.

He looks in both directions down the hallway.  "Where would a drink be?" he mutters to himself, as he walks towards the lobby.  "I hope they have alcohol here.  Crazy cults might be anti-alcohol," as he turns the corner leading into the stairwell.

A woman is standing there, her eyes narrow and fixated on him.  Her mouth is pursed in a scowl as he walks passed her.  She turns  as he passes, her eyes following him.  She lifts her finger, tracing a black-painted finger nail across her neck as her eyes bore into his chest.

Eyes wide, Simon's steps quicken, and he is down the stairs.  He turns around to see if the women is following him, but the stairwell is empty.  He walks to the front desk.  The woman from early in the day is still sitting there, still reading her romance novel.

"Do you sell alcohol?"

She nods her head and points to the small cantina behind a locked gate.  She holds up a notepad that contains the word "closed" on it.  Simon shakes his head.  "No exceptions, huh?"  The women shakes her head.

Simon lets out a quick sharp breath.  He turns around and starts to walk back towards the stairwell.  He feels a soft hand on his should, turning back around.  The woman is holding a bottle of vodka in front of her.  She closes the distance between them, her other hand coming to rest on his chest.

"Oh, I'm," his voice stuttering, "flattered, but," her hand is on his waist band, her fingers dipping below.  He removes her hand, "No."

# Max

Dominic is fast asleep in the bed next to Max.  Max's eyes are bloodshot and ringed in red and black, the bags under his eyes are telling of his lack of sleep.

The sun is beginning to stream in through the window as Max swings his legs over the edge of the bed.  Naked, we walks over to the window, peering out of the blinds.  The quad-rotor is glistening with early morning dew, the sun streaking across it turns it into a multifaceted jewel amidst the sprawling gray of the parking lot.

He picks up his pants from the chair, and slides them over his legs.  He starts to pick up his shirt, smelling it, and then puts it back down.  Grabbing the room key, he walks out of the room, locking the door behind him.

His bare feet pad silently down the carpet, a mind-altering pattern in orange tones, tricking the eye in swirling, mutating shapes.  This is not technology, but awful hotel carpeting used all over the place last century.

He descends the three floors to the lobby.  A young boy, no more than fifteen years old with dark skin, and thin, sharp cheekbones sits behind the front desk this morning.  He smiles a large toothy smile, and Max gives a quick wave, as he rounds the corner, and exits the back of the dormitory.

The yard behind the dormitory is not much more than a patch of grass, a couple of picnic benches, and a small fire pit.  There is a small sandbox in the corner for the children.  The wet grass is cold against his bare feet as he walks out.

He raises his hands up to the sky, stretching every muscle in his body, elongating, reaching.  He folds in half at the waist, hanging his torso towards the ground.  He alternates between these two positions for a count of twenty.  He turns around towards one of the picnic benches and jumps at the sight of a Chinese woman, face creased heavily with age.  She sits on the picnic table, a nicostick in her withered left hand.

"Oh, sorry, I didn't realize anyone was here."

She shrugs.

"Right, you don't talk. Why am I talking?"

"Because we lack discipline," her voice is soft, smooth, almost angelic in a way.

"I thought?" Max approaches her, and sits down next to her.

"Yeah, they've all taken a vow.  There is no point, no reason behind it."

"Then why do they do it?"

"They have a romantic notion of monastic life.  Vows of silence, eating simple foods, all that crap."

"Why are you at this commune if you don't believe in their way of life?"

She waves her hands around, "I own all this, before the commune moved in, I was broke, now," she shrugs, "Now I don't have a care in the world."  She motions towards the dormitory, "And it's not like they can annoy me."

Max laughs an inaudible laugh, his stomach shaking.  "Good point."

The woman takes a long drag on her nicostick, exhaling like the hiss of a tire with a slow leak, the serpent's hiss to warn of impending trouble.

# Ji

Ji is piloting a small quad-rotor over a sea of sand that stretches as far as her eyes can see.  The reflection of the noonday sun on the sand causes her to squint, even through the electronic tint on the rotor's cockpit.  The dot on her nav system is getting closer and closer, but it looks like empty sand all around.

She pulls back on the throttle lever and the altitude drops quickly, landing amidst a cloud of sand.  Pulling a bandana over her mouth and nose, she hops out of the vehicle.  A single tree stands, dead and withered, bleached white, a brilliant finger stretching to the heavens.  A small red button is embedded in the trunk, barely visible to an unexpected visitor.  She feels around for it, pressing it in when her fingers find it.

The ground beneath her begins to rumble, the sand shaking, a thin line forming next to the tree and growing wider centimeter by centimeter.  The sand falls away, tumbling down stairs that are beginning to form.

The rumbling stops, the stairs descending into darkness.  She begins to walk down them, shielding her eyes from the sun.  She feels each step with her foot before settling her weight down, transferring over to the foot, repeating the process down into the darkness.

The stairwell ends in a wall and without warning causing her foot to kick the wall.  She reaches her hands out, feeling along the wall.

"Goddamnit," she grouses to herself.  She turns around, feeling the sides of the stairwell, beginning to go back up.  Another wall closes off the stairwell, a reverberating thud throwing Ji into complete darkness.  She jumps, startled at the sound.

Lights click on, bright and antiseptic.  She shuts her eyes tight, the sudden change of light causing pain behind her eyeballs.  A gruff, robotic voice booms through the small room, "State your business."

"Ji Go, Silver Member of the WLF, Member Number 934-51-965013"

"Please wait."  Anachronistic computing sounds are played over the hidden speaker, a series of beeps, boops, and bleeps designed to evoke progress is being made.  "Voice print verified, Welcome Member Go."

The wall at the bottom of the stairwell begins to rumble and move to the side.  She taps her foot waiting for the slow motion of the ancient door to open wide enough for her to step through.  Unlike the newer phased-magnet doors, this one moves on a horizontal track, moved by permanent magnet motors, driven by a series of belts, pulleys and gears.

When the door is finally open wide enough, she steps through into a hallway lined with holoprojectors and consoles, each one with a person sitting at it.  She walks passed all of them, each turning to stare at her as she passes, silent, and furiously typing on the keyboard, the sound of fingers clacking on keys is deafening.

At the far end of the hall is another door, simple, and even older.  It is not automatic with a round knob sticking out of it.  She turns the knob, and pushes the door inside.  The room behind is pure white with an even light spread across it, making the corners near impossible to notice.  She has the sense of floating in an infinite white void when she enters the room and closes the door behind her.

A black man sits in the center of the room.  He is a tall man with lanky limbs.  He is wearing an ash gray suit, cut trim to fit his thin frame.  He smiles when he sees Ji, revealing crystal white teeth, large, taking up all the space in his mouth.

He stands, offering his hand.  She takes it, and he pulls her into an embrace.  "Ji, my dear."  His voice is soft and melodious.

"Ramon, I wish I could say this wasn't a business visit, that we could spend the hours talking about something, anything else, but I'm here to ask a favor."

"Mmm, I see, sit." He gestures to the couch where she found him.  "How can I help?"

She lays out the details of the plan along with the background information about NewTek, Dominic, and Max's invention.  After she is done, he sits for a long time, in seeming meditation, processing all of the information Ji presented.

"Mmhmm" after a full ten minutes.

Ji fidgets in her seat, not wanting to disturb him.

"Well, I think we can help."

She jumps off the couch, "Thank you!"

He stifles laughter, and motions for her to return to her seat.  "I will ensure you get the support you need from the WLF, but now, business is concluded, and now, friends discuss their lives and well being.

They talk for another hour, exchanging life stories, talk of philosophy, and the recent rise of monastic orders.  Ji leaves feeling nourished.

***

Visiting Ramon always puts Ji's mind at easy, and she is confident and ready to execute this plan.  The quad is loaded up with infiltration suits for storming the Capitol Building.  She sets the nav system for the Medford Commune, releasing her hands from the controls.

This quad is outfitted with a new waypoint nav system that Ramon's people installed while she was down in the bunker.  She bites on her nails, double checking the readings.  The heading is on track, all system read outs are within the nominal range.

"Relax, Ji, the tech is new, but Ramon would not have ordered it installed if he did not trust it, and you trust him," her voice drowned in the chatter of the rotors.  She forces herself to settle into the seat, and close her eyes.  There won't be much time for sleep in the coming days.

***

The quad-rotor touches down amidst a sandstorm kicked up from the rotors.  The beeping on the console rouses Ji from her sleep.  She rubs her eyes, looking around.  The Medford Commune dormitory is in front of her.  The quad landed right next to the other quad.  The early morning sun just beginning to peak over the horizon.  She rubs her eyes, and jumps out of the quad, running to the door.

The door is barred from the inside.  She knocks twice, tapping her foot.  She crosses one foot over the other, squirming in place.  She knocks three more times, pacing in quick turns.

"Oh fuck it!" she runs over to a near by bush, pulls down her pants, and lets loose a stream of urine into the parched sand next to the bush.

# Dominic

He begins to wake up, his limbs not quite under his control still in the hold of his sleep.  Sun is glaring in from the open window, his vision awash in sunlight filtered through eyelids.  He flicks his eyes open, to an empty room.  Giving his eyes time to adjust, he blinks rapidly, eventually sitting up after some concentration.

He takes a minute to muster the concentration to stand, his legs unstable under him.  With shuffling steps, he walks to the door, grasping the frame to steady himself.  He pushes the door open and steps into the hallway.

Various unnamed people are milling about the hallway, each one dressed in dingy white uniforms, a mix between a chef's uniform and scrubs.  Each one is bare foot.  They stare at him as he pads down the hallway to the main lobby.

The stairs prove to be difficult to navigate down, and he stumbles on the last few steps, catching himself on the railing.  The dining room off of the lobby is empty, save for Max, Vienne, and Simon.  They are deep in discussions with a map projecting into the space between them.  The soft hum of Vienne's holoprojector drones on as he approaches.

He walks up behind them, unnoticed until he leans over to get a better view of the map, asking, "So, what's the plan?"

All three of them look at him, eyes blinking, mouths agape.

Simon is the first to speak, "All better then?"

Dominic shakes his head.  His eyes rolls back into his head, eye lids fluttering as he is overcome with dizziness.  "Not exactly, but better."

Max stands up, motioning to the chair he just vacated, and Dominic takes the queue, sitting down.  Max pulls up a chair from one of the other tables, and sits in it, flipping the back to face the table, resting his arms on the back of the chair.

Ji looks around, and continues the conversation from between Dominic interrupted, "Like I was saying, Wolf will provide a hyperjet to get us into UCSA airspace as quickly as possible, and then we'll parachute onto the roof of the Capitol Building, here."  She places a marker on the map over the Capitol Building, "we'll do this all under the cover of night.  Radar invisible parachutes and body suits, all wolf provided."

"And who is we?"  Simon asks.

"Dominic, assuming he heals, and me.  Max and Vienne will be ready with the transmissions to broadcast the recordings once the cabinet has been secured."

"And what will I be doing?" Simon again.

Vienne strokes the side of his face, "looking pretty, dear."

His eyes narrow at Vienne, "I'm not useless, you know."

Ji interjects, "We know, but I'm not sure what your role will be yet."  She exchanges glances at Vienne.  "Since you don't have any specific training for the things we are doing."

Simon exhales violently, and stands up, leaving the table and the room.

"Simon!" Vienne calls after him.

All eyes looking at the table, the silence awkward and thick with unsaid words.

Dominic holds back a smile, "Maybe you should go after him?"

Vienne eyes throws daggers at Dominic's face; she stands and runs after Simon.

"Awkward." Dominic's voice an octave higher than normal, with long exaggerated syllables. 

"Child." Max glares at Dominic.

"Back to the plan, yeah?" Dominic turns to look at Ji.

"No, that was pretty much it, after the cabinet is secure, we release the transmission of the evidence against the UCSA, along with the stream of the occupation of the cabinet members and Governess, claiming allegiance to the WLF, and demand the world council address what the UCSA has been doing." Ji spews.

Dominic nods his head.  "When do we start?"

"Shipment from wolf is expected to be here in the next few days, then it's wait until you are one hundred percent so we can execute properly.  I am relying on you to get us into the Capitol Building."

Dominic nods, "Right, I've got it covered."

Ji smiles, "I know, I've read your file from Vienne."

Max stands up, helping Dominic to his feet, "Time for us to go… relax."

"Nothing too strenuous, wouldn't want to risk Nic's recovery."

Max slowly draws his fingers from the corners of his mouth to the center of his lower lip, tugging slightly, pulling his fingers away, "Don't worry, nothing too strenuous."

# Vienne

Vienne catches up with Simon, "Simon, wait," she pulls his arm with a tender touch, as he's about to exit the building.

"What Vienne?  I'm useless, I might as well not be here."

She pulls him into her and reaches under his shirt, running her fingers delicately across the ridges of his abs, "You aren't useless.  You are here to stay safe, so I have a reason to do this."

"Isn't Nic your reason?"

She snorts with laughter, "No, it's Nic's fault we are here, sure, but he's not my reason. I could have turned him in to Alexandrine, secured clemency for us."

"You aren't making your case very convincingly."  He pushes her hands out from under his shirt, and crosses his arms over his chest.

"It is simple. What would we do after that? No company would touch us after that scandal."

"They aren't going to touch us now either."

"But it won't matter.  A new form of organization will arise, a new serpent's head, and we'll need someone to be the figure head of that new head."

"And I'll be the first whore to you as the new figurehead?"

She wraps her arms around Simon, "No, I'll be the woman pulling the strings, you'll be the figurehead."

He shakes his head, pushing her away. "So I'll be your talking dummy."

"That's not what I meant," she pulls him close again, but he immediately pushes her off.  "Okay, go sulk, when you are ready to be an adult again, I'll be in the room."

She turns around, leaving him framed in the doorway as she makes her way to the stairwell.  She hears the door slam shut behind him.

# Levi

Levi is in heaven.  The room he stands in is lined, floor to ceiling with weaponry and gadgets of every kind imaginable.  A small kiosk in the middle of the room blinks specs at him.  He presses on the picture of an ArmaLite AR-15 reissue.  This particular model is throwback to old rifles, but with modern technology running the insides.  It includes a DNA print safety system, laser sight, and friendly anti-fire to avoid friendly fire.

When he presses on the vend button, a robotic arm extracts itself from the ceiling, slides along magnetic levitation rails.  It selects one of 10 ArmaLite AR-15s, retrieves it from the shelf, and deposits the weapon into Levi's hand.

This dance continues as he arms himself with a bullet and stun proof vest, anti-puncture under garments in a shrink-wrapped package, and five grenades of varying types, some explosive, some stunning and obscuring.

As he loads up the gear on his person and in a duffle bag also retrieved by the robotic assistant, Alexandrine enters the room, ducking the arm as it zooms passed her.

"Finding everything to your liking, Mr. Kane?"

He turns around, brandishing the AR-15 reissue with a half-cocked smile on his face.  "Oh yeah," his voice warbles with grit.

"Excellent.  I've secured your hyperjet, it's on launch pad three, ready when you are."

"Have you located Dr. Bosko?"

"We believe so.  Satellite scans show a quad-rotor registered to Nakitashi in the middle portion of the northern west coast no man's land."

"Just north of the great tunnel?"

She nods, sending her curls bouncing.

"And the order again?"

"Capture Dr. Bosko, kill anyone helping him."

Now it is his turn to nod.  "Understood, you prefer kill over capture for all other individuals?"

She shrugs, "I guess whichever is easier."

"You're the boss lady."

She smiles brightly, "Yes, Yes I am."

# Simon

The room is dark.  Simon is sitting in the middle of the bed, naked, staring at the wall.  His eyes are vacant, his breathing slow and methodical.  His back is completely straight, and his hands are resting with a delicate touch on each of his thighs, upturned to the ceiling.  His feet are folded under him, and his thighs are pushing his scrotum up.

His breathing sounds like the ocean as he lets his vocal cords relax but obstructs the airflow slightly. He sits, unmoving.

Vienne opens the door, the light of the hallway placing a wide stripe of yellow light across his torso.  She closes the door with a silent deft movement, and walks into the room on eggshells.

"Simon?  I'm sorry."

He does not answer, continuing to stare at the wall.  She rolls her eyes, and stands between him and the wall.  His eyes blink back tears.

"Simon, you do play a valuable role."  She places her hands in his upturned hands, as she sits down on the bed in front of him.  He flinches at the initial touch, and relaxes into the sensation of her hands.  Tears rolls down his cheek.

"Talk to me, Simon."

"Why don't I matter to you?" his words soft and delicate, lip trembling as they move to form the words.  She removes her hands as a response, standing up from the bed, adding distance between them.

"If you didn't matter to me, I would have left you in NewTek City, I wouldn't be trying to keep you at my side, to keep you safe.  If you didn't matter, you'd be dead,"  her words cut like swords as she slings them out into the air.  He hangs his head, his response to her.

"Snap out of it, you are just feeling sorry for yourself," she walks out the room, the door slamming behind her, reverberating in the door frame.

# Ji

Ji is sitting in the dining room with her face buried in broadcast operation manuals, with a blueprint of the Capitol Building spread out like a placemat under all her work.

She feels a tap on the back of her shoulder, and her head pops up, looking at the woman who owns the commune.  Ji snaps, "What?"

"You have no manners," the old woman says, her tone flat, disinterested, almost bored.

"I know, I've heard that my whole life. Wait! You aren't supposed to talk."

The woman shakes her head, sitting down across from Ji, "Didn't that pretty boy explain things to you? Anyway, I over heard your plans."

"Oh, and now you want money to keep quiet?"

"Your generation, always so paranoid and thinking the worst of people."

"With good reason."

"Sure, sure, I don't want any money.  I want you to stick it to those bastards."

Ji laughs, "Alright granny."

"Don't call me that, you little shit."

"We'll stick it to them good and hard."

"What can I do to help?"

"I don't know, what can you do?"

"I have a small stockpile of guns, you could take your pick, you and the boy with the head injury."

"Guns? Really?"

"We get the occasional marauders out here.  I usually fend them off, scavenge what I can.  They never expect it, never see it coming, but we're all pretty good fighters here."

Ji shrugs, nodding her head.  "Thank you! Definitely useful."

"Sure thing, we do have a doctor among the members.  Would you want your friend's head wound looked at?"

"Sure, just send them up to his room."

# Max

The room is dark.  Dominic is fast asleep, laying naked above the covers.  Max can still taste him, as he sits up in bed next to his sleeping love, a book, one of the many romance novels from the lobby, in his hands.

Max rolls his eyes, and drops the book on to the side table as he stands up from the bed.  His feet carry him without hurry across the room, to the window.  The sun hurts his eyes as he opens the blinds a crack, the warm beating heavy against the large wooden slats of the blinds.

He watches a couple of children play with a ball in the sandy lot behind the dormitory, kicking it and shouting at each other.  He turns to look back at Dominic, who is lost in the darkness of the room, Max's pupils taking their time to adjust to the change in light.  He picks up his underwear from the floor, sliding them up his legs, and into place.  Grabbing his shirt, and pants, he finishes getting dressed

He leans over Dominic to check on his breathing, and then walks to the door, opening it.  He is startled by two people standing on the other side of the door when it opens.  The old woman he met earlier, and an older gentleman, though younger than the woman, wearing spectacles, carrying a small black bag, a faded red cross on either side of the bag.  He towers above her.

"Dr. Jarnes would like to have a look at Dominic's head," the woman mutters as she pushes her way into the room.

"He's sleeping right now," Max follows them back into the room, rushing to pull the sheets up over Dominic's naked body.

Dr Jarnes walks over to the bed, turning on the side lamp.  He puts his bag down on the bed, opening it with slow precise movements, pulling out a pair of gloves.  He slips them on with the same meticulous movements.  He motions in a circular motion, miming the flipping of a page.

Together the woman and Max turn Dominic onto his side, propping him up against a pillow.  The sheets pull away, leaving his butt exposed as the doctor leans in, pulling up the bandage.  The doctor cleans the wound with rubbing alcohol, the sting waking Dominic up with a wince.

A clean bandage reapplied, and Dr. Jarnes gives a thumbs up.  The woman and Dr. Jarnes leave the room, and Max helps Dominic settle back into bed.

# Levi

Hyperjets have never been Levi's preferred mode of transportation.  The moment of disorientation during the initial acceleration, and the subsequent deceleration  on landing causes him great distress, but it is required in this case.

"Sedative now being administered," the computer voice intones in the headset.  A moment later, his eyes begin to flutter, his consciousness fading out.

***

Adrenaline courses through his veins, "Adrenaline dispensed, please allow a moment for your heart rate to return to normal before deplaning."  His eyes shoot open, heart racing heavy in his ears, alert.  He concentrations on relaxing his breathing and heart rate.  It takes him ten minutes for the adrenaline shot to work its way out of his system, and his heart rate to return to normal.

"Heart rate within nominal range, release harness, thank you for flying Hyperjet."  Some engineers idea of a joke, he is sure of it.  The five point harness releases, and he falls forward, doubling over, his head spinning, bile creeping its way up his throat. He swallows hard, his adams apple bouncing.  Pushing his hands into the ground, with steady but cautious movements, he lifts himself to his feet.

He opens the storage locker, removing the Armalite AR-15 reissue, and slings it over his shoulder, followed closely by the grenade sash.  The exit ramp from the jet extends down to the sandy ground, and he steps out into the bright sun.

The commune dormitory is a middling building made of brick standing in a large expansive parking lot.  The ruins of other builds surround it, most worn down to the foundations.  The dormitory is an oasis in the concrete desert.

Faces peer out of every window, as he exits the jet, gun drawn, and walks slowly towards the building.  An old Chinese woman stands at the front door, just outside of it, barring the way.

As he approaches, she yells out, "We are a peaceful commune, violence is not tolerated within my domain."

He raises his voice to match, "I'm not here for anyone but your guests."

"My guests have sanctuary.  Violence will not be tolerated.  Remove yourself."

He is closing the gap between them with increased vigor.  "Woman, I don't want to hurt you."

"That won't be a problem, but I'm afraid, I can't promise you the same in return if you continue to approach."

He pulls his gun up to his face, leveling the sights on the woman.  "I have permission to kill anyone who stands between me and Maximilian Bosko.  Do you hear me? Anyone!" he draws out the last word, adding extra syllables.

With hidden movements, she is inside of the door, pulling a large leaver to the left of the door.  Metal shutters begin to close all around the perimeter of the building, barricading the building from the outside.  He runs to the front door, the shutters not engaged yet.

He bangs on the glass, staring at the woman.  She smiles at him as Ji and Vienne take up flanking positions to her.  Levi takes aim, and lets a bullet loose.  The sound causes all three woman to jump as the shutter slams shut.

Suddenly, the ground under him gives way, and he's falling, sliding with dirt, sand, and dust down a smooth metal chute.  It is a gentle slide, and he lands on his feet in a clear reinforced holding cell, small not quite enough room to lay down fully.  He bangs on the glass wall as the opening to the chute slams shut.

# Simon

Simon is wearing the white scrubs of the Commune members as he sits in the dining room.  Vienne, Ji, and the old woman are sitting across the table from him.

"You want me to pretend to be a commune member, and go interrogate this mercenary?"

All three of them nod their head, but Vienne is the one who speaks up, "He doesn't know who you are, it's the perfect job for you.  Go crush his balls, get information from him."

"How do I do that? He's got guns!"

"Demand he gives you the guns.  There is a double drawer for passing items.  Only one side can be opened at once.  No way he can use the gun when it's in the drawer. "

"But what if he overpowers me?"

"He won't, we'll put in some nerve gas that disrupts his ability to control his muscles before you go in there." The old woman pipes up, "Don't ask where that came from."

Simon nods his head, "Okay, I guess I'll do this?" uncertainty seeps into his words, is visible on his face.

# Levi

Levi is leaning against the chute door when Simon enters the room.  "Just give me Maximilian Bosko, and I'll let your little cult live," voice deadpan, even, with contempt beginning to edge in to the words.

Simon shakes his head, extending a finger out towards the gun slung over Levi's shoulder.  Then, he swings his arm to move the finger to the drawer, transforming his finger into a palm, pressing in on the drawer.

It extends into the cell, pressing into Levi's stomach as it reaches across the cell.  Simon points at the gun again, with a flick of the wrist, his finger points to the drawer.

"Not going to happen, you mute twig."

Simon takes a piece of paper from his back pocket, with deliberate, slow movements, he unfolds the paper, contemplating the words on it.  He flips the paper around and bangs it against the glass.

"Nerve gas?  Yeah, like you have nerve gas."

Simon takes a second piece of paper from his front pocket, unfolding it faster than the last one, holding it between his thumb and index fingers at each corner of the paper, light pressure holds it long enough for Levi to read, and then it slips to the ground.  Simon turns around, and begins to walk out.

The sound of the drawer banging closed stops Simon in his tracks.  He turns around, the drawer extended into the room.  Simon turns around, and approaches the drawer.  One eyebrow arches up as he peers into the drawer.  The Armalite AR-15 sits in the drawer.

Levi holds up the clip, shaking it between his two fingers.  "You get the gun, but I keep the ammo."  Simon shrugs.  "What are you going to do to me?"  Simon shrugs again.  A hissing sound begins, soft at first, but building as a bluish-white gas begins to stream in from the ceiling.  Levi begins to bang on the glass as Simon pulls on a gas mask.

"You fucker, you have no hon–"  and he hits the floor.  The gas stops with an abrupt woosh, as the air is evacuated, replaced with a fresh supply, and then the glass walls recede into the floor.

Simon bends down, kicking the clip into the corner.  He grabs Levi's shoulder, and flips him onto his stomach.  Pulling his hands behind his back, Simon attaches MagCuffs™ to his wrists, and then attaches the wrists to the chute door.

The sensor on the gas mask beeps three times, and Simon removes the mask.  He sits down in front of Levi, crosslegged and out of arm and leg reach.  Taking a small aerosol can from his other front pocket, he sprays Levi in the face, a purplish shiny powder covers his mouth and nose, and Levi's eyes snap open.

"You fucking psycho!"  he thrashes against the MagCuffs™, legs kicking and flailing out from his body.  "I will murder you all now!"

"Shut the fuck up. We can do this the hard way or the harder way. Or you can just cooperate, tell me what I want to know, and we stick you tied up back on that hyperjet, and send you somewhere, to God only knows where."

"I'm a mercenary, what are you offering me?"

"To… not be… tortured?" Simon questions.

"You do not have that in you, little boy."

Simon is up in the blink of an eye, rope around Levi's neck, tightening in small increments.  His hands tremble minutely, his teeth bared, salaciously close to Levi's ear.  Hot breath grazes across it.  "I have more in me than you know."

The old woman steps out of the shadows, "And I'll do far worse than my disciple here."

"Anzhi?" Levi's voice laced with confusion.

"Yes, Levi."

"You… I watched you die!"

"There are many forms of Death, that was but one.  Now, tell me who sent you, and why you are bothering my guests."

"UCSA Governess Alexandrine Brant.   Executive order to kill Dr Bosko, and everyone involved in his escape."

Anzhi shakes her head, "I did not raise you to be an assassin, Levi Kane.  Consider your contract forfeit."

Violent shaking of his head follows, "No, You know I can't, not the UCSA."

"Simon, please excuse us, inform the others that Mr Kane has been neutralized as a threat."

Simon nods, exiting up the stairs, closing the door behind him.

"Cute kid, but he's not one of your disciples."

She chuckles, "No, no he is not, but I think he would have strangled you quite well.  Now, Levi, you have a rare opportunity to take a moral high ground here, not an option mercenaries are ever afforded."

"And what is that?"

"Help us take down the UCSA.  Your Dr. Bosko developed a mind control device, and the UCSA is bent on having it for their own plans.  I fear for that."

"Because you prefer good, old-fashioned brainwashing?"

She crosses the room, and squats down in front of him.  Her hand traces a delicate line down the side of his face before she slaps him across the face, hard, sending his head to the end range of his neck's motion.  "You have your choices, either die here, or join us.  While I did not raise you to be an assassin, my mother raised me to be one.  You have one hour to decide."

She stands, turning away from him, making her way to the door, "You always where my favorite pupil, Levi."  The door slams closed behind her.

# Dominic

The glass cell is empty.  Dominic's forehead rests against it, feeling the cold seeping in from the ground.  The bandage is gone from his head, and the cold glass is invigorating.  "So… what happened to the mercenary?" He turns his head towards Vienne who is standing in the corner.  A shawl is wrapped around his shoulders, huddled against the cold of the room.

"Anzhi wouldn't tell us much, but she persuaded him to join us, let him go, and he too the hyperjet, somewhere.  She's being cagy about it."

"Can we trust him?  Can we trust her?"  Dominic's shoulders raise and lower.

"What choice do we have?"  Vienne approaches him, taking his hands into her own.  "I'm glad your head is better."

He laughs, "Yeah, pretty stupid, huh?"

She tilts her head to one side and then the other, the corner of the left side of her mouth coming up into a smirk.  "It's cold down here, let's head up stairs."

Dominic nods and follows her out the room and up the stairs.  When they enter the dining room, dinner is in full swing.  The dining room is overflowing with people in white scrubs, the clang of plates and dishes are the only sound in the room, but it is deafening.

He scans the room for Max, but they have all taken to wearing the white scrubs, and the sea of white does not part to reveal Max.  "At least the food is good here." Dominic comments as they pick up a tray of food.  The plate is full of cheese-covered noodles, small elbow tubes, and a piece of meat, unidentifiable, but seasoned well.

Dominic's words unleash a wave of eyes, all fixated on him.  He rolls his eyes, as they follow him, digging their stares into his skin.  He bangs his tray down on a table.  The three people sitting at the table pick up their trays, and move.  They keep their eyes on him as they transfer to another table.  Vienne joins him after a moment.

"I'm getting really sick of this place."

"As soon as the Hyperjet gets here, you'll be off."

"Wasn't it supposed to be here by now?"

# Ji

The news feed running across Ji's holoprojector explodes over and over.  The news anchor is reading in a monotone voice, "A hyperjet, believed to be part of the terrorist organization, The WLF, has been shot down over the Mojave Desert.  It was believed to be heading to pick up members of the newly activate cell that is claiming responsibility for the bombing of Nakitashi Central Processing. "

Ji's head hangs loosely from her neck as she listens.  When the report finishes, she palms the projector off, and stands up.  Her feet move with slow deliberation, sliding across the floor as she makes her way to the door.

Down the hallway, and down the stairs, she enters the dining room, tunnel vision on the floor as she walks.

She looks up as she crosses the threshold into the dining room.  Her voice loud, startling, "Team, meet me outside."  The dagger eyes settle onto her.  She extends the middle finger of both of her hands, waving them back and forth at the people in the dining room.  She turns around and exits out the backdoor.

The evening is cold, winter is coming.  The wind blowing in from the north, bringing with it an icy chill that cuts through the thin material of the scrubs.  Ji's nipples stiffen and rub against the fabric as she walks out of the building, and settles onto one of the picnic tables.  She shivers as she waits.

One by one, the team trickles out, with Simon being the last one out.  Max settles into Dominic's arms to stay warm, while Vienne pulls her shawl tighter around her.  Simon remains distant.

Anzhi lingers in the doorway, smoking her nicostick, listening.

"A hyperjet was shot down over the Mojave Desert.  I don't know if it was Levi's or the one that Wolf sent, but it means we need to change our plans.  I believe the next best thing is to drive."

Vienne's eyes bulge, "Drive?  Are you crazy?"

"It will be a hard road, but Dominic and I can do it."

"And the marauders?"

"We'll go on bikes, we can move faster than they can."

"If they don't ambush you."

"I have some nightsights, we can travel in the dark with no running lights.  The bikes are pretty silent, so we should be able to avoid them in the most dangerous areas."

Vienne turns to Dominic, eyes pleading, "Don't do this, there has to be another way."

Dominic shakes his head, "This is the only way.  Ji and I discussed it, we are doing it.  We leave in the morning."

***

Dust covered, and painted matte black, the two motorcycles are almost invisible against the early morning sky.  Ji is stuffing the last of her gear into the compartment under the seat.  A backpack is slung low across her back, bulging with food bars, and liters of water.  Her nightsight goggles are perched on top of the thin alloy helmet she is wearing.

Dominic exits the building, his body sheathed in the black body suit, plates of armor covering vital organs, and androgenizing his nether regions.  The nightsight goggles over his eyes glow with a soft red glow.  He carries his backpack high against his shoulders, a rope coiled across the top.  He walks over to the bike, and swings his leg over it.

"Ready?"  His words transmitted to her via a microphone attached to his throat, picking up the vibrations of his vocal cords and transmitting them to Ji's ear piece.  It lends a mechanical tone to his words.

Ji nods, swinging her leg over and revving the motorcycle to a start.  The vibration between her legs sends a tingle up her spine.  Dominic takes his cue from her, revving his bike to life, and then take off down the road.

# Dominic

The road is long and monotonous, and after a day and night of hard riding the forest gives way to the desert expanse that is the middle of the continent.  This land uses to be verdant fields of wheat, corn, and soy, but those days are long since over.  Over farming and irrigation gave way to the destruction of the permaculture that sustained life in this area for so long.  That death turned it all into a desert wasteland, empty of life.

And the desert stretches on forever.  They pull off the road, to the hollowed out shell of an old gas station.  Sand covers everything, but they pull into the station, pulling the motorcycles behind the one remaining wall of the station.  It is not much for protection from being seen, but will offer them adequate protection from the sun during the day.

The sun is beginning to crest over the horizon.  Dominic switches the nightsight goggles to day mode, and the red fades into an amber filter.  "I'll take first watch, get some sleep."

Ji nods, pulling a small bedroll from the back of her motorcycle as Dominic places a few sensors around the outside of the ruin.  "No jerking off while I'm sleeping, boy!" she shouts as she tightens the sleep mask over her eyes.

Dominic settles in, small pistol in his hands, eyes alert.  As the sun rises fully above the horizon, the temperature begins to spike.  Even in the shade, he fears it is going to be uncomfortable hot.

***

The sun reaches its zenith.  Dominic looks at the read out on his suit, "115F", and he wipes the sweat from his brow.  He unzips the suit, pulling it down his torso, and ties the arms around his waist.  His second watch period is agonizing, a deadly combination of heat and exhaustion is beginning to take hold.  He stares out into the vast ocean of desert.  Visibility is shifting, the horizon to the north disappearing in a shroud of shimmering brown.

He pulls out a pair of binoculars, a high tech pair with variable zoom, image enhancing capabilities, and the ability to view different energy types.  He whips him up to his eyes, and looks at where the horizon should be.  Monotone and churning, he catches the glimpse of a small cyclone amidst a larger storm system, and from what he can tell, it's heading directly for them.

He shakes Ji awake, "there is a sandstorm heading right for us.  We need to move, quickly, let's get out of here."

Ji jumps to action, packing her gear away before Dominic can even process the fact that she is awake and moving to quickly.  Moments later, they are on the bikes, zooming forward and away from the storm.  This path forces them off the road, onto the shifting sands of the open desert.

It is a race against the storm.  The edge of the storm could be anywhere, but they need to make it to the edge to survive.  They push the bikes to their limit, engines close to red lining, having to make constant small adjustments as the sand moves under them, a dovetail of sand kicking up behind them.  Heart bounding and the vibration of the engines intensifying, the edge of the storm begins to appear in the distance.  Ji points at it, and Dominic nods his head.  The motorcycles will not go any faster, and the storm is closing in.

The front of the storm rolls over them in a sudden surge, a cloud of dust and sand swallowing them whole.  Visibility is cut to zero, and Ji is nowhere to be seen.  He flips on infrared mode on his goggles, but the sand is warm, radiating infrared all around them.  He switches to radar mode, but the bikes and their suits are cloaked against radar.

Ji is lost in the sea, but Dominic pushes on, driving forward, adjusting for the tug of the wind, pushing against his bike.  He knows the edge of the storm is near, if he can make it, he will survive, if not, the sand will take him.  His focus narrows to a laser, and he drives on.  After five agonizing minutes, the sand buffeting against his bare torso, like sharp, stinging insects by the millions, the sand wearing his skin raw, he breaks through the edge of the storm.  The winds die, and the sand settles, pushing further south.

He pulls to a stop, breathing heavy through his face mask.  He rips the mask off, heaving breaths in and out.  He stares into the storm, waiting for a sign of Ji.  He calls out on the comm system, "Ji, Ji are you there?"

He waits.  No answer.  "Ji? Please?" No answer.  The sun beats down on him, high in the sky, just passed the hottest part of the day.  The shimmer of the storm continues uninterrupted.  "Ji, I'm sorry, but I need to ride on, find shelter.  I'll turn on my beacon, so you can find me."  *I hope she got that message*.  He revs the engine, and rides on, the air rushing against him, cooling his skin nearly as fast as the sun is heating it.

He turns the bike slightly north, hoping to reconnect with the road, if he has any hope of finding shelter for the rest of the day.  After half an hour, his wheels reconnect with broken concrete, back on firm ground, he accelerates.  Twenty more minutes, and he comes upon an old church, broken down and sun bleached, remnants of the stain glass windows are melting downward, frozen in a state, mid-melt, casting vivid pools of light onto the ground and the one remaining sandstone wall.

He pulls the bike into the shade with great haste, cowering under the eaves of what is left of the roof, a splintered mess, once majestic wooden arches reaching up to the heavens.  He pulls his suit all the way off, and turns it inside out to dry off the sweat from the inside.  In the shade of the church, he sits on the sandy floor, his small white briefs soaked through with sweat.  From his backpack, he pulls a food bar out, and begins to eat it.  One a day is all he needs, but it does not keep his stomach from growling.

He rummages through his gear in the bike seat, looking for the perimeter sensors.  *Fuck, I forgot to pick them up when we were fleeing the gas station* "I guess I'll just have to be lucky that no one sneaks up on me while I sleep."  He curls up under a blanket, trying his best to block out the light.  His mind drifts to oblivion as he falls fast asleep, body exhausted from the stress.

***

When he wakes, the night time has fully set in.  He checks his watch *four hours of sleep isn't so bad*  He pulls on the nightsight goggles, switching them to low-light mode.  The world bursts into red hues as the click on, and he looks around.  *All quiet*  He pulls his suit back on, a fine layer of salt having formed on the inside makes it easier to put on.  He reattaches the throat microphone, and switches the comm system on, "Ji?" But still no answer.

Rolling the blanket up, stuffing it back into the seat, he readies himself for the next leg of the trip.  He pulls out one of the bottles of water, and takes a long drag before swinging his leg over the bike, and starting the engine.  A vulture is startled by the sound and flies into the sky.

Pulling back onto the road, he begins to head east again, the road is long, straight, and unending.  *four more days through the desert*  He sighs heavily as he accelerates. *maybe I can make it three*  These motorcycles are high efficiency models with super-capacitive storage cells allowing him to drive almost uninterrupted through the night.  He will only need to stop to relieve himself and stretch.  He can drive flat out for four hours at a time at top speeds.

Every hour blends into the next, the road stretches on and on, and he drives.  Eight hours from his embarking for the night, he pulls into a small town, most of the buildings have been razed to their foundations, with every tenth one still containing at least one wall.  Tents dot the area, with camp fires throwing long shadows across a small crowd of people.

The largest fire contains an animal on a spit roast, spinning in languid rotations over the fire, a small boy manning the crank.  Dominic slows the motorcycle to a crawl, switching on stealth mode to cut as much noise as possible.  The motor's hum dies down immediately.  He crawls along the road, approaching with deathly silence until he is close enough to make out the group around the large fire.

He slows to a stop, pulling the binoculars out if his backpack, training them on the large fire.  A stick breaks behind him, and a stun baton connects solidly on his back.  He falls to the ground, writhing before passing out.

***

The cold of the wet sand seeps into his unconscious mind, and the sounds of beating drums drive his mind awake.  He sits up, hands tied behind his back, stripped bare.  His eyes search the darkness, struggling to make shapes, discern anything in the pitch black of the night.  A slit of light appears, and grows wider.

The light is eclipsed by the figure of a woman, breasts bare, thin material wraps around her waist, slung low, the back light making the material translucent, the curve of her legs a stark shadow against the fire light.  "Stand up."  Firm words but at the same time delicate.  He obeys.  "Outside."  She turns and walks outside, and he follows closely.

There are eleven elders sitting on rocks arranged in a semi circle on the far side of the fire.  Five of the elders are men, each of distinct ethnicity.  The five women elders mirror the men.  The last elder lacks outward vestiges of gender, and all eleven are clothed in long flowing robes, dyed the color of blood, and covered in a fine layer of dust.

Dominic eyes fall to rest on his motorcycle and backpack, laid on the ground near one of the tents.  A small boy is sifting through the food rations, holding it up, scrunching his nose at it, and putting it back in.  He watches the little boy, until one of the elders shifts in their seat.

The non-gendered elder stands, crossing around the fire, and in front of Dominic.  "Outsider, you were caught sneaking around, dressed in assassin garb. What say you?"

Dominic coughs, the fine dust of sand billows out of lungs and into the air, and then he speaks, "I am just traveling through."

"Lies!" the elders scream in union.  The one who is confronting Dominic continues, "Your belongs were searched, the weapons are those of an assassin.  Why are you here?"

"I'm just traveling through, I was caught in the sand storm, I was cautious because there are marauders, and I was not sure if you were friendly or not.  I mean no harm."

"Lies!" the elders scream in union again.  "My brethren do not believe you."

"What can I do to prove my innocence?"

The elders confer among themselves for a moment, and then speak in unison, "Trial by combat."

The non-gendered elder spreads their hands apart, "Beat our strongest combatant in hand-to-hand fighting, and we will consider your innocence a known truth."

"Do I have a choice?"

All of the elders shake their heads.  "No. Put him back until the morning.  The fight will happen at first light."  The woman who brought him out, leads him back to the tent, and pushes him down into the tent.

She ducks in behind him, and grabs his wrists, spinning him around, and hooking the ropes that bind his hands onto a hook, anchoring him in place.  Her bare skin against his skin is hot, she leans in and whispers, "I believe you."  He feels a small piece of metal drop into his hands. "Take me with you," she pleads in hurried whispers, and she backs away from him, and out the tent.

*Well, shit.*  He shifts the piece of metal around in his hands, a makeshift blade, and rough leather wrappings to make a handle.  He flips the blade to face out, and begins to work small back and forth motions with the blade against the rope.  The night is frigid and his naked body absorbs the cold readily, his body covered in goosebumps.  He continues to work the knife against the rope, making slow progress as the strands of the rope begin to fray, and pop.

Finally, the rope pops fully apart, freeing his hands.  It has only been twenty minutes.  His best guess is he will need to wait for three hours before attempting his escape.  *Waiting sucks*  He sits in the cold, shivering, counting his breaths, trying to slow his heart rate.

After three hours, he cracks open the tent flap, and snoops at the area outside of the tent.  The fire is nothing but embers, not enough to see well by.  *First order of business, goggles.* His clothes were piled next to the motorcycle when he was speaking to the elders, so he can only assume they are still there.  He steals out of the tent, and into the night air, colder than the tent.  *Second order of business, put on some fucking clothes.*

He dashes over to where the motorcycle is, its outline visible from the glow of the embers, reflecting off of the black chrome of the wheels.  He gropes around for the goggles, fingers connecting and pulling them up and onto his face.  Switching them on, the camp comes into view.  Everyone is vacated, except the woman from earlier.  She is curled up, fast asleep, next to the tent where he was being held.  He slips his suit back on, gathering up the backpack.

He approaches her, and places a hand on her shoulder, shaking softly, hand over her mouth to keep her from making a sound.  Her eyes snap open and meet his.  He puts a finger up to his lips, and then motions towards the bike.  She stands with graceful flourish, and follows him over to the bike.

He pushes the motorcycle away from the fire pit, towards the road, with her trotting after him.  Once at the edge of town, he swings his leg over the motorcycle, mounting it like a horse, and then motions for her to join him.  She wraps the material around her waist a few times, hopping on the back, and wraps her hands around Dominic's waist, holding tight.  He starts the motorcycle, no longer in stealth mode.  The engine revs and echoes out across the valley.  He shifts it into gear, and zooms off.

Her arms tighten around him as the speed of bike increases, pressing herself into him, shivering, the night air cutting through what little clothing she wears.  The night fades into dawn as they ride.  As the sun crests over the horizon, a series of small squat buildings rise with it.  He accelerates, heading into the middle of arrangement of buildings.

Another small town, this time truly abandoned, no people, no sign of animal life, completely dead.  As they approach, he slows to a crawl, inching forward eyes darting around, scanning the terrain in all wavelengths.  No heat signatures, no signals, nothing.  He sighs a deep sigh, pulling the bike next to one of the buildings, this one says "bank" on it.  He dismounts the bike and walks over to the door, pulling on it.

The door does not open, locked from the inside. Bending down to inspect the lock, he notices it is a completely mechanical lock, old, but well preserved.  As he ponders the lock, a rock hurls over his head, breaking the glass of the door, raining glass shards all over him.  The woman walks up, reaches into the building and unlocks the door.  She pulls it open and walks through.  Dominic's mouth agape, he watches her movements with detached amusement.

"What? It was practical."

Dominic nods, walking into the bank.  The lobby is modest, a local branch of some regional bank, teller windows line one wall, and the vault sits open behind it.  The formica and wood paneling of the building smells musky, but there is no dust.  This building has been sealed for a long time, a tomb of some unknown culture. Dominic draws his gun, surveying the lobby, advancing with slow measured steps to clear the room.

"What's your name?" he calls to his traveling companion.

"They call me Mags, thank you for rescuing me."

Dominic shrugs, "You were going my way."

"What do I call you?"

"Sorry, my name is Dominic, or Nic if you prefer."

"Are you really an assassin?"

A half smile spreads across his face, "Not really. I hate killing people."

"That's a shame."

"Why?"  Before Dominic notices, she is at his throat with a shard of glass, pinning his gun arm to his side..

"Because now this won't be any fun for me."

She is strong, stronger than Dominic in raw strength.  "What in the actual fuck?"  Dominic does not struggle, waiting for the right time.

"No hard feelings, doll-face; it's just business."  

His motions are a series of staccato flashes of movement.  He drops weightless, the sudden impact rips him out of her grip, the shard of glass falling to the ground with the tinkling sounds of glass shattering on the marble floor.  His back hits the ground, descent slowed by her grip, spinning around, his legs sweep her legs out to the side, and she loses her footing, toppling on top of him.

She punches him in the face, and he responds by wrapping his legs around her, using the leverage of his legs, he rams his forehead into her nose, the crunch of cartilage breaking, blood beginning to flow.  She reels falling over to the side, and Dominic is swinging off his backpack, as she is standing, readying for a charge at him.  *Fuck this*  He swings the gun up to take aim, but she is too fast, knocking him into the wall, his lungs evacuating.  He breaths in heavily as the gun is skidding across the floor.

She lands another punch to his face, but the third one he is able to dodge and she punches the stone wall.  She leaves a smear of blood on the white wall, a mixture of their blood, some from his face, some from her knuckles which split open on the failed punch.  Dominic dodges the punch by sliding down and between her legs, rolling across his shoulders, making it to the gun.

But she is on him in an instant, her knee pinning the hand holding the gun to the floor.  She drives her other knee between his legs.  The pain is hot and searing, his hand loosens on the gun.  She smiles.  "Fucking men."  He breaths deeply reasserting his hold on the gun as she tries to take it from him.

She is prying his fingers up one by one, his legs flailing, his torso pinned by her weight.  He makes a wild swing with his free hand, but misses the connection.  The gun slides out of his grip as she frees it.  She places it between his eyes.  "Say good night, little boy."  She pulls the trigger.  Click.  She pulls it again.  Click.  "What the fuck?"

Both hands free now, and with her confused, investigating the gun, he launches a counter attack.  A small sliver of glass is lodged in her leg now as she screams out in pain, the gun dropping to the ground.  He pulls his legs out from under her writhing mass, swoops up the gun, and levels it at her, returning the magazine into it's rightful place.  Keeping the gun trained on her, he walks over to his bag, and frees the rope, binding her hands behind her back, and anchoring them to her ankles.

"Okay, Mags, talk."

She spits in his face.  "Fuck you."

He places the gun between her eyes, "Talk.  Who hired you?"

"You aren't going to kill me, you already said you hate killing people."

"Hate it, yes, I never said I haven't done it."

"Not an assassin, huh?"

"Not like you.  Talk!" spit flies out of his mouth, small droplets forming from his words, and landing on her face.

She remains silent.

"Don't make me do this, please?"

She remains silent.

"Fine."  He roughly picks her up, leading her to the vault.  He places her in the center of the vault.  Rows of safety deposit boxes line he perimeter of the room, all intact, unopened, containing treasures unknown.

He swings the vault door closed, leaving her in the vault, alone.  He turns the wheel, engaging the bolts.  The keys to the vault are still attached, he removes one and puts it around his neck.

*She can sleep it off in there; I'll be safe for the day.*

He walks back to the lobby, pulls off his suit, and collapses onto the cold marble floor.  *two more days* floats through his head as he drifts off to sleep.

***

Banging sounds nudge Dominic from his slumber.  The evening is already upon him, and the banging sounds intensify.  *How did she get out of the ropes?* he ponders and he pads with bare feet over to the vault, stepping deliberately to avoid the broken glass.  He takes the key from around his neck, gun drawn, and inserts it into the vault mechanism.

The pressure differential from the vault rushes passed his naked body as he spins the wheel and pulls the vault door open, leading the way with his gun.  She has her hands up as he gets sight of her; her eyes fix on the muzzle of the gun, the shard of glass sits on the ground, covered in blood, part of her wrap roughly torn and wrapped around the wound.

"What?"  Dominic is cold, shivering from the air in the vault.

"If you are going to kill me, just do it.  Don't leave me to die in this vault."

Dominic tilts his head to the side, knitting his brow.  "You aren't leaving me much choice.  Who hired you?"

"UCSA."

"Governess Brant is pulling out all the stops."

"She has spies everywhere, though I was expecting two of you."

"So was I."

She screws up her face, "What does that mean?"

He shakes his head, "Nevermind."  He closes the vault door, relocking it.  She bangs on the door, words muffled beyond comprehension, and he walks back into the lobby.

He pulls his suit on, the stretchy fabric caressing his weary body, pinning his morning wood tight against his pelvis.  He adjusts for comfort, and packs up his backpack, pulling a food bar out, nibbling on it, while thinking.

He pulls a marker out from one of the side pockets, and exits the building.  Scrawling in large letters "She is in the vault" across the front of the building.  He goes back inside and inserts the key into the vault door.  Stowing the pen, and retrieving a couple of chemlight sticks, some ready-set epoxy, and a flare from the backpack.

Back outside, he breaks the chemlights to activate them; he mixes the epoxy, coating each chemlight in a layer, and sticks them to the build exterior to illuminate the writing.  Backpack on, with the engine started, he shoots the flair into the air, and rides off east.  *best I can do*

# Ji

Ji emerges from the sand, gasping for air after she has cleared the sand.  One edge of the motorcycles handle bar is visible above the sand, the rest buried under the storm deposits.

She dusts herself off, surveying the area as she does.  Empty sand stretches in all directions.  Using her hands as shovels, she begins to shovel the sand off of the head of the bike.  Progress is slow, the sand slipping through her hands.  The heat of the midday sun beats down on her as she continues the futile effort of digging the motorcycle out.

An hour passes, and she is baking in her suit, but the headlight is now above the sand.  At this rate, she will fry her brains from heat before getting the bike out.  She pulls the backpack off of her back, searching in it for water.  She pulls the bottle out and takes a long swig. Reinserting the water, she pulls out a tarp, white and reflective on one side.  She huddles under it, a brief respite from the sun, she unzips her suit down to her navel and pulls it down around her waist.  Under the tarp, she begins to cool, enough to avoid heat exhaustion.

*Wait until the sun starts to set* she reassures herself, settling in for a few tense hours of waiting.  The time passes imperceptibly for her, each minute stretching on into infinity. *Next time, pack cards.*  As slow as it is, the time passes and the light shifts under the tarp as the sun crosses the sky, headed to the horizon.  As the cool wind begins the blow in under the tarp, she throws it off, and continues digging.  The sun has long since set by the time she completely unearths the motorcycle.

She inspects all of the intake ports, and digs sand out from them.  The last thing she needs is for trace amounts of sand to destroy the engine.  After thorough inspection, she starts the engine which purrs to life.  She sighs a deep sigh, her shoulders relaxing down her back.  She mounts the motorcycle from behind, throwing the backpack on to her back as she does, and accelerates.  *I know where he's headed, let's hope we both make it.*

***

Ji's night is uneventful, and as the sun is beginning to rise into her eyes, she pulls into a church, abandoned with one wall standing, and stained glass.  Motorcycle tracks lead from the road into the church ruins.  She approaches with caution, wary of the tracks, but as she rounds the corner of the wall, she sees the tracks continue off back onto the road.  She relaxes visibly, as she pulls in and dismounts the bike.  She inspects the ground, noticing the pattern of the disturbed sand, the pattern of a sleeping pad, and hasty movement.

Etched into one corner of the sandstone wall is two simple letters, "Ji".  *Dominic* she thinks as she inspects the wall.  She activates her comm system, "Nic? Nic? are you out there?"  She waits, but no answer comes.  *Bugger, wish I had sprung for the more powerful transmitters.*

The curls into a ball, and falls fast asleep, the day passes without incident, and she is back on the road at dusk.  Half way through the night, she is approaching the small tent town, the fire is raging in the center square, there is a large amount of activity around the fire.  She approaches lights on, not wanting to startle the town folks.  She rides up, engine roaring.  Two guards flank her as she nears the entrance to the encampment.

"Stop! Who are you?"

"I'm just traveling through, please let me pass."

"We've had problems with people just traveling through."  The other guard yells.

"I do not want trouble, and I do not ask for your hospitality, just let me drive through," she shouts in response.

"Hey Vig, is that the same type of cycle the other traveler was riding?"

"Dig, I do believe you are right."

"Sorry, missy, you aren't going anywhere."

Ji puts her hand on the pair of guns strapped to her legs on either side of her.  With precision, she pulls the guns, and lands two bullets, one between Vig's eyes, and the other through Dig's neck.  The shots ring out in unison across the town.  She redlines the engine and speeds through the tent city, knocking tents over, driving through a few of them, as she speeds through.  She hears the sound of engines turning over behind her, fading into silence as she speeds away.

*Must keep going*

She pulls back on the throttle some, taking the engine out of the red zone, and checks the temperature gauge, elevated, but still nominal.  She thanks the wind and the cool night air.  Her resolve reinvigorated by Vig's mention of the other traveler, a sure sign that Dominic made it out of the storm and is continuing onwards with the plan.  *Also, fuck you for not trying to find me, Nic*

She rides on, stowing her helmet on the seat behind her, hooked onto the rear with the chin strap.  The cold evening air flows sharply through her hair, whipping it in cyclones behind her.  She rides on until the morning, but she lacks a place to sleep, no shelter can be seen for miles.  She knows she needs to push on until she finds a place to stop that will shade her from the sun, but her eyes are heavy, sleep wants to take her victim.

Off to the side of the road, a good distance from the main road she spies an old farm house.  Like everything out here, it's a mere shell of its former self, but it will do, she turns the back off road, kicking a rainbow of sand behind her as she speeds to the house.  It is a small two story house, the floor of the second story mostly intact, she rides up.  She stashes the bike behind the dead and emaciated bush on the side of the house, and slips inside.  The inside is dark with a musky smell, the smell of decay, of bodies picked clean by carrion.

She shakes her head, sitting down near the window frame, glass long since broken and discarded.  She leans her head against the wall, and falls asleep after images of her room at Nakitashi dances through her head.  She sleeps for only six hours, the sun nearing the horizon, but not quite there yet.  She packs quickly, and returns to the motorcycle, waking it in awkward circles to point it back to the road, away from the setting sun. 

She has been back on the road for no more than an hour when a flair shoots up in the sky ahead of her.  She recognizes the signature magenta color of Nakitashi Road Flares, she lobbied for that color choice, after all.  *Nic? Please let that be Nic*  She kicks up the throttle, zooming towards the flares origin point.

She pulls to a stop in front of the bank, the chemlight sticks stuck to the wall.  "Who is she?" *Did Nic leave this for me?  Whoever she is, why didn't he take her with him?*  She waffles for a moment, but continues to drive on, *Nic would have taken her if she was useful.*  She pushes on, hoping to catch him before the next sunrise.
