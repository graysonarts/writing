# Dominic

Dominic's life is not his own. The stories he tells are a lie. It has been this way for so long that he is becoming a master of believing his own lies, but this is how he makes his living.

The sun is starting to crest the top of Nakitashi Plaza, tracing a laser beam of searing light across his eyes.  Muscles tighten, fractions of a second, and slips out of bed, and begins to pad across the smooth tile floor. He turns back to confirm that Max is still asleep.  Max's form lifeless but for the gentle rising and falling of his breath, and the flutter of his eyelids.  Dominic muses about what dreams are playing behind those eyelids.

The apartment they share is small, not much more than a bedroom. They have a small bathroom, but the shower is down the hall, along with the shared kitchen. Smooth, white space-age polymer tiles cover the floor and walls.  The ceiling is exposed, expanded concrete, reinforced with a lattice work of steel ribbons.  This design was considered modern once.

Dominic shuffles into the bathroom.  Urine streams explosively into the toilet, the sound deafening in the silence of the morning.  He picks a pair of shorts out of the clothes hamper, and slides them on. He flushes and continues out of the apartment.  The only thing on his mind is coffee.  Until that happens, he's not really functional.

It's a religion, a ritual, an incantation. Power, Water, Grind, Fill, Tamp, Extract. It's the only truth he knows at this very moment. The liquid dark and syrupy, frothy golden head. Quick motions and it is down and warming his insides.

The sound of foot steps echo down the hall, and he turns to look.  Ji is rotund. She is also short.  Dominic nods at her and starts to make her a coffee.

"Why are you always naked?"  Her voice is gruff; her accent is slight but still audible to the trained ear.  She wears a yellow jumpsuit with a brown lightening bolt down one side, stretched out over her body.

"I have shorts on." Dominic shrugs as he hands her the coffee.

"Those are barely shorts; I can see your penis." Her words sharp, each syllable pinched off with accusation.  Smoothing into a softer tone, almost pleasant. "Not that I'm complaining."

A slight shake of his head. "Ji…"

"Yeah, I know. You and your boys.  Where is the dainty one?"

A smile creeps across Dominic's face, "Max hates when you call him that.  He's still sleeping.  We are the only morning people in this lovely place."

"Fuck that, I'm not a morning person. I like to see your penis, and you make good coffee."  A hearty laughter erupts from her taking on the form of a deep guttural cough before petering out.

# Max

The smooth silken sheet hangs lightly over Max's long, lithe body. Sunlight bathes the room, reflecting off the white tile, making it impossible for Max to escape it.  It is the time of the morning where the bedroom is stifling hot. The covers cascade to the ground as Max reflectively kicks them off, exposing his body to the sunlight. The sun skips across his naked body.  He rubs his eyes, trying to rouse his senses.  

"Alexis, what time is it?" he calls out.

A small purple ring embedded in the wall begins to pulse, an older model digital assistant is part of the apartment, a perk for Nakitashi corporate housing.  It's slow, but functional.  After a few seconds, the disembodied voice of Alexis responds, "The time is 10:33am. You will be late for work, Max".

Muscles twitch, a quick response, a part of his ritual, perpetually late for work.  Grabbing a towel, he runs out into the common hallway, streaking towards the showers. 

At this time of the day, most people are already at work, so the showers are empty.  Max quickly covers himself in the industrial, multipurpose gel that Nakitashi provides as the most efficient, lowest environmentally impactful cleaning product possible.  The shower fills with a mixture of sulfur and lavender.  This stuff always gives Max a headache for at least an hour.  Another rough morning for the rising star of the biomech division of Nakitashi Corp.

Two minutes are entering the shower, he's toweling himself off as he shuffles his way back to his apartment.  Stepping through the door, Alexis chimes in, "You have received a message from Akio, shall I read it to you?"

Wincing at the name, "yes."  The purple ring pulses languidly as the processor generates the words for Alexis to speak.

"Presentation this morning?  11am, you get here, now"

"Oh fuck!"  Max grabs a pink tee-shirt, a grinning cat sketched across half of it, slipping it over his head.  He pulls on his favorite pair of embedded shorts, a slim black pair with sensors that monitor air quality and muscle activation.  He rushes out the door forgetting to put on his shoes.

He touches the implant on his right wrist lighting up the time under his skin.  The glowing numbers read "10:45am".  15 minutes. He can do this.  Through slight movements of his fingers, he scrolls through menu items to find "car".  A couple more movements and a company car is waiting for him as he exits the corporate housing building.  He gets in the car, and it speeds off to Nakitashi Plaza.

…

11:01am stares at him through the glass of the meeting room walls. His hurried steps continue, throwing open the door, and huffing for air.  All eyes are on him.  Akio stands at the front of the room.  "Ah, just in time.  What do you have for us, Maximilian?"

Sweat drips down into Max's eyes, his finger trembling as he keys his access code into the conference room table.  A holoprojector turns on from above the table.  A deep breath slowly trails out of his mouth, a shuttering release of air.  "Perfect worker compliance" he begins.	

# Vienne

NewTek International Holdings is an umbrella corporation primarily responsible for stealing most of the technological advancements in the last 50 years.  Vienne is a handler for NewTek International Holdings. Her primary responsibility is being the contact person for a small group of spies that NewTek International Holdings employs.  These spies are in deep cover, sometimes years at a time, infiltrating neighboring corporate states, and relaying information back to NewTek so they can beat people to market with new technologies.

Vienne is pacing in her office on the top floor of the KK building, NewTek's espionage wing. They call themselves the Advanced Research Division, but that is just a euphemism. It is common knowledge, but NewTek is too powerful for any other corporate state to try to stop them.

Vienne is pacing because she has not heard from her best agent. He's been undercover for 5 years now.  She bites on her fingernail, cracking it, cursing under her breath.  A large operational monitor covers the entire wall opposite her desk.  Her eyes dart between the monitor and her desk's holographic display.

She leans over and types another message into the console.

"Nic, questioned allegiance. Need to meet. NT Bar, midnight. Pls Rspd"

"That little fucker better not be turning on me."

Simon is standing in the doorway unnoticed.  He clears his throat, and Vienne's eyes lock onto him.  "What?" she snaps.

"The leaders are getting concerned, Madame." His English is rough, unpolished, thick with an uncomfortable accent.  "They are concerned with his length."

"Nic is our best agent.  I'm going to be reasserting his allegiance tonight.  Tell them I have it under control."

"Madame, they fear he is turning."

"He isn't turning.  He's a professional."

"Five years, lies can start becoming real, Madame."

"Not with Nic."

"How can you be sure?"

"He's our best agent."

"Yes, Madame."  Simon touches his ear and stares at the ground for a second.  "They are requesting a full diagnostics report after tonight's rendezvous."

# Dominic

The lab is built in the same way as the corporate housing.  White polymer tiles are a consistent feature everywhere, and for Dominic, they are suffocating today.  He rereads the message, sighing heavily as it flashes across his eyes. The eye implant is undetectable, an advancement that is still a few years away from being available to the general public.

His fingers twiddle across his left wrist, typing out: "Can't, Max will suspect. Mrng Run, 5am, NCP?"

"Fine." flashes.

Dominic returns back to the device sitting on his workbench, rescrewing the access cover, and flipping the switch on. A small puff of smoke rises quickly from the device, and he switches it off again.

…

5am: An electrical signal from his implant stimulates his pituitary gland, beginning a slow increase of cortisol into his blood stream.  The bedroom is dark, but the cortisol speeds up his heart rate, increasing blood flow over his entire system, and his eyes shoot open.  He slips quietly out of bed, puts on his running gear, and slowly closes the door behind him.

Nakitashi Central Park is at the exact middle of the Nakitashi corporate state.  It is the nexus point, the layout of the state funnels into Central Park from all directions.  Legend has it the state is laid out according to some ancient superstitions about placement and energy flow.  Dominic believes it.  Central Park is a magical place, a sanctuary where he can escape who he is, what he is doing, and how he's betraying Max.

Vienne is a tall woman with jet black hair.  He has never seen her wear anything with color, and today is no different.  She leans against a decorative arch, sucking in on a nicostick, the vapor slowly trailing out of her nose.  The light of the predawn just starting to flood in, she is a monochrome vision of the likes of a John Huston film.

She approaches him, and embraces him tightly, kissing him lightly on both cheeks.  "My dear," she whispers into his ear.

"My allegiance is in question?" He gently creates space between them, a small gesture that does not go unnoticed.

"Yes.  The leaders are concerned."

"And?"

"They want a full diagnostics report."

"I'm not some robot."

"Aren't you?"

"Fuck you, Vienne.  You are the one who ended it, not me."

"And now I'm assigned as your handler.  This isn't about us."

"You are right, it's not."

"Are you going to allow me to get the diagnostics report willingly?"

"Yes." He holds out his left wrist, and she takes it. Her fingers travel lightly across his skin.  "Damn her" he thinks as a tingle travels down his spine.

She removes a small device from her pocket.  It's a nondescript black box with two wires dangling from it.  She places the wires on each side of his wrist, and swipes the cover of the box.  "Remember, this will hurt a little." She presses the red X that has appeared on the box, and all of Dominic's muscles tense, eyes clenching against the pain.
