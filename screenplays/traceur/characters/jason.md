JASON is 18 in the summer after he graduated from high school.  He's accepted that he is gay, but isn't ready to come out.  His mother inherited a bunch of money, and lives comfortably in a house on Mercer Island.

He started doing parkour when he was 16, and besides parkour he likes to draw, and has an affinity with comic books.  He draws an indie comic about parkour superhero that he publishes on the internet.  He has a small following of loyal readers, mostly people from high school / parkour community.

At the end of high school, his girlfriend broke up with him, but it was pretty much mutual since he was finally ready to accept himself.  While he watches gay porn, he hasn't been attracted to a guy in the real world before.  He has a tumblr where he sometimes posts half-clothed pictures of himself, but never with his face in them.  He flirts with some other guys his age on the site, but only ones that live far away from him.

His favorite color is Sinopia (#C94110), though he calls it dirty-orange.  His favorite scent is cedar.  He mostly listens to electronica, and is favorite band is Juno Reactor.  His older brother introduced him to the band when he was younger.

He tends to wear parkour clothing, preferring tank tops, hoodies and joggers. (see mood board).  When not wearing things specifically for parkour, he wears chinos and tee-shirts, with a hoodie (very seattle).
