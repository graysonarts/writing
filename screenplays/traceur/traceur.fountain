INT. JASON’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

The BEDROOM has mostly undecorated walls with a messy DESK situated under the window.  A small BED with a side table sits against one of the walls that isn’t the windowed wall.  

The DESK has a LAPTOP sitting on the table.  A GOPRO camera is attached.

An ALARM CLOCK blares a loud, repeating incessant beeping. [[The ALARM CLOCK is beeping during the establishing shot of the room]] The sound continues for a long moment before JASON, a short, late teen with short cropped hair wearing only a pair of boxers, throws off the covers of his bed, hitting the alarm clock.

JASON walks barefoot across the floor and walks through the doorway

INT. JASON’S BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING

JASON drops his boxers to the ground and steps into the shower, turning on the water, bracing himself for the cold water.  The water runs for a while before he settles into showering.  He pulls a towel off the wall and dries his hair briefly, and then wraps it around his waist.  He walks to the bedroom

CUT TO:

INT. JASON’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

JASON picks a pair of sweatpants off the ground and smells them.  He drops them back onto the ground, and searches for another pair from his closet.  He pulls on the pair, and picks a shirt in a similar fashion.  He ties his SHOES, a beat up pair of PARKOUR SHOES, and grabs the GOPRO off the desk, throwing it into a small BACKPACK.

CUT TO:

INT. LINDA's KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

The kitchen is a large kitchen with a center island and large windows to the outside.

LINDA, a middle aged woman with messy hair wearing oversized pajama pants and a tank top, is sitting at the island with a unadorned and plain work LAPTOP open in front of her.

JASON rushes into the kitchen, grabbing a CROISSANT off the island near LINDA.  He kisses Linda on the cheek, puts the croissant in his mouth, and runs out the door with the croissant hanging from his mouth.

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

The bedroom is filled with MOVING BOXES that are stacked on and near a DRESSER that is obviously IKEA.  The bedroom is small.

ALEX, a tall boy with bed hair wearing a pair of trunks, is searching through one of the boxes, throwing clothes over his shoulder.  He pulls a pair of pants out of the box, and slips them on.  He does the same for a shirt, and a pair of shoes.

ALEX opens his LATOP and searches for parkour spots in Seattle.  FREEWAY PARK shows up, and he them looks up bus routes to FREEWAY PARK.  He writes the bus routes on his hand.

EXT. FREEWAY Park - Morning

The park has a small group of TRACEURs warming up when JASON arrives.  They greet each other with combinations of high fives, handshakes, and half-hugs.  The energy of the group is friendly and excited, everyone is smiling as one of the traceurs shows a video of a move on this phone.  Then, JASON begins to warm up, bouncing in place, and stretching various body parts.  The rest of the group follows suit.

A few of the group begin jumping up onto a nearby railing, balancing on the rails.  More join until all are balancing on the railings.  DANIEL, a slightly older boy, jumps from one rail to a nearby low wall.  One by one, the group follows suit.  JASON is last in the line, and the last to the wall.

The group continue to train around the blocks, with JASON's movements smooth and confident during the training session.

> SHORT MONTAGE of TRAINING

[[I'll flesh out the montage with a shot list when the time comes.  It's short, mostly just showing them moving through the park, establishing that they know the park well, and that they are regularly training together. ]]

INT. BUS - MORNING

ALEX has EARBUDS in and is staring out of the window as the city passes by.

EXT. FREEWAY PARK - MORNING

ALEX leaves the bus and walks into the park.  JASON is finishing a wall pass and drops down next to ALEX.  JASON misses his footing slightly and falls into ALEX.

JASON and ALEX climb back over the wall, and ALEX shakes hands with the other TRACEURs who are training with JASON.

ALEX joins in, but is cautious and uncertain of his movements.  They continue training for a little while, and anytime that JASON sees ALEX watching, he becomes clumsy. After JASON misses clips his toe on a simple step vault, bailing at the last minute with ALEX looking on, he shakes his head and stands up.  He limps back to the group with his head hanging, unable to meet ALEX's eyes.

INT. LINDA's KITCHEN - MIDDAY

LINDA is sitting the dining room table with a LAPTOP open in front of her.  A small PLATE with a SANDWICH sits on the counter.  JASON enters from outside, sweaty, pulling off his shirt.

He limps forward towards his the back of the kitchen, and LINDA looks up at him from her LAPTOP.  She gives him a stern, motherly, "what the fuck did you do" look, and he rolls his eyes and shrugs.  He grabs the sandwich from the counter, and limps up to his bedroom.

INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - EVENING

ALEX is in a pair of scrub pants, unpacking a box that contains books, adding them to a small BOOKSHELF in the corner.  The books are fiction books [[I'll figure out which titles later, probably classics mixed with Scifi]]  There is a knock on the door and SID, a short haired woman with a pierced nose wearing vaguely punk rock clothes, pokes her head in.  ALEX looks at SID and nods, heading out the door after placing a book onto the shelf.

INT. ALEX's KITCHEN - EVENING

SID, ALEX, and SIMON, a man wearing a polo shirt and a backwards cap, are sitting at a table, eating burritos.  The sound of a TV playing soccer can be heard in the background, and SIMON is preoccupied with the TV.  SID is reading a book, and ALEX shifts in his chair as he eats.  After a moment, he pulls out his phone.

INT. JASON’S BEDROOM - EVENING

JASON is sitting at his computer, looking at a text book and typing into the computer.  His phone dings and he picks up the phone.

ALEX (text)
Nice meeting you.

JASON looks at the phone.  There is a pause as JASON puts the phone down and picks it back up, unsure what to say.

JASON (text)
Yeah, I'm glad you showed up

He deletes the text.

JASON
You did really good today

He deletes the text, and drops the phone down on the desk, rubbing his hands through his hair in frustration before picking up the phone again.

JASON (text)
me2.

He hits send, and then returns to his computer. JASON's phone dings after a brief moment.  He sighs loudly and picks his phone up with sharp motions.

ALEX (text)
cu tmrw?

JASON (text)
(thumbs up emoji)

EXT. FREEWAY PARK - MORNING

ALEX is sitting on the top of a concrete block when JASON and the other TRACEURs enter the park.  ALEX jumps down greet each other.  They begin training, and JASON and ALEX begin chasing each other, clumsily.

ALEX is chasing JASON into an alleyway that dead ends, and ALEX ends up not stopping fast enough, crashing into JASON.  They bang against the wall with ALEX pressing into JASON.  There is a brief moment between them before ALEX pulls away.

ALEX scratches his head and turns away from JASON, dashing off out of the alleyway.  JASON begins to run after him.

EXT. FOOD COURT - Midday

The group from earlier is sitting around a TABLE, BURGERS, FRIES, and SODAS are sitting in front of them.  Most of the group are talking, cutting up, looking at footage on their phones.  ALEX and JASON are sitting opposite each other, looking on as the others interacting.  JASON steals looks at ALEX and ALEX does the same, but only when the other isn't looking.

The phones are put away and the boys start eating.  ALEX steals one of JASON's fries.  JASON tries to steal one of ALEX's but ALEX blocks his hand.  They fight back and forth as JASON attempts in vain to get one of ALEX's fries.  At one point, ALEX grabs JASON's hand.  The smile from JASON's face vanishes in a moment, and he pulls his hand away.

JASON pulls his phone out and looks at the time.  He motions that it's time for him to go, and he picks up his backpack and takes off.

ALEX watches as JASON leaves, and then drops his head, staring at the table, mixing the ketchup with a fry.  The rest of the group look towards ALEX and shake their heads.

INT. ALEX's BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

ALEX, wearing a tank top and pair of jeans, barefoot, is pulling PICTURES out of a box.  The PICTURES are unframed and show ALEX with various people from his past.

He lingers on a photobooth photo of him and another boy, both shirtless, kissing in one of the frames.  He sighs and slips it into a drawer of his dresser.  

INT. JASON’S BEDROOM - EVENING

JASON is laying in his bed, staring up at the ceiling, in only his boxers again.  His phone is laying on his chest.  It dings and he picks it up, looking at the screen.


ALEX (TEXT)
I had fun.

JASON (TEXT)

ALEX (TEXT)

JASON smiles at the ceiling, placing the phone back on his chest.

INT. JASON’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

JASON is searching for clean clothes again, slips on dirty pants and a dirty shirt, tying his shoes again.


INT. JASON’S KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING

LINDA is sitting in the same place.  This morning, there are muffins on the counter.  JASON hovers over the muffins for a moment, picks one up, turns it over and then puts it down.  He kisses LINDA on the cheek and leaves the kitchen.


EXT. GASWORKS Park - Early morning

JASON is crouching on top of one of the arches.  He pulls out his phone and checks the time, and then looks around.  A moment passes, and he checks his phone again.


ALEX enters the park, and JASON notices him, laying flat against the top of the arch.  ALEX checks his phone, looking around for JASON.  ALEX texts JASON

ALEX (TEXT)
Here.

JASON's phone dings and ALEX looks up.  They smile at each other.  JASON lowers himself down and stands a bit too close to ALEX, and then he steps back, increasing the distance.  ALEX looks at his shoes and then turns around and begins running.


JASON follows ALEX as they run up to the top of the hill and then back down.  They continue to run towards a field at the far edge of the park.  ALEX jumps towards the wall at the edge of the field, but misses the muscle up, and falls back down.  JASON jumps and muscles up on top of the wall, flipping around, facing ALEX.

JASON smiles at ALEX and ALEX backs up, and tries again, making it this time.  JASON drops down the other side of the wall, and ALEX follows, but stumbles on the landing.  JASON catches him, and they hold each other's gaze for a moment.

ALEX moves in closer, and he puts his hand on JASON's arm, leaning in to kiss JASON.  JASON moves backward and looks over his shoulder, and then looks the other way.  He climbs back over the wall, motioning for ALEX to come.  ALEX follows and they head into the covered area of the park, 

As they round the corner into a more secluded area, JASON grabs ALEX's hand, and pulls ALEX against him.  He pushes his  face forward and kisses ALEX on the lips, quickly, retracting back.  JASON pulls back, but ALEX pulls him in further, pulling him into a deeper kiss.

EXT. FREEWAY PARK - AFTERNOON

The group of traceurs from the previous day are running and jumping near the bottom of Freeway park.  JASON and ALEX are sitting on one of the pillars, sitting facing each other, animated discussion between them.  JASON and ALEX each find reasons to lightly touch each other as they talk.

DANIEL stops training to watch JASON and ALEX as JASON laughs and poke ALEX in the stomach.  DANIEL taps one of the other traceurs on the shoulder and points up at JASON and ALEX with a head nod.  They exchange a brief silent chuckle and smile.

INT. JASON’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

JASON is laying on his bed in a pair of briefs propping himself up on his elbows, writing in a NOTEBOOK with a TEXTBOOK open in front of him.


His PHONE dings multiple times. He slams his textbook closed and picks up the phone.

ALEX looks at JASON for a moment and then gives him a hug.  After a moment, ALEX pulls JASON to sitting on the bed, keeping JASON's hand in his own.

JASON rests his head against ALEX's chest, and ALEX puts his hand on JASON's face.  ALEX pulls JASON's face up towards his and kisses him softly on the lips.

INT. JASON’S BEDROOM - MORNING

JASON and ALEX are in bed together, both in their underwear.  JASON has his arms around ALEX.  LINDA opens the door, and looks in on the boys.  A brief, small smile crosses his face, and she slowly and quietly closes the door.  JASON and ALEX continue to sleep.

INT. JASON’S KITCHEN - MORNING

JASON and ALEX, both dressed in clothes from yesterday, come down the stairs, entering the kitchen.  LINDA pours them both coffee, and JASON grabs ALEX's hand.  LINDA looks at that and smiles, exiting the kitchen.

JASON steps backward, but DANIEL is quicker, and pulls him into a large hug.  They pull back from each other and smile.  JASON grabs ALEX's hand again, and pulls him close.
