The weight of Riley's backpack slows his steps, each foot dropping heavy onto the stairs, echoing in the empty house. The sharp edges of the door knob scrapped against his palm as he wrestled with the ancient mechanism of his bedroom door.  One last sound to close off the rest of the house as the door crunched back into place.

His backpack dropped from his shoulders onto a small mound of clothes spilling out from a hard-shell suitcase.  He presses his toes into the edge of the suitcase, pushing it fully back into the closet, and turns back towards the center of the room, and the inviting comfort of the twin mattress set in the middle of the room.

He frees himself from the tight confines of the necktie, and takes two steps as he unbuttons the light blue shirt with the intricately detailed crest of Holy Cross Catholic on the pocket.  Tossing the tie and shirt onto the back to the short, faux branch backed chair, he rolls onto the mattress.  The pink and lace duvet presses patterns into his skin.
